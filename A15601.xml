            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T may perhaps ſeeme ſtrange, that in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of ſo cleare and manifeſt a light, and to the view of ſo learned and judicious a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I ſhould be bold to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a taske of ſo homely and domeſtique a ſtraine; for I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20885:12"/> know that there is not one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you who hath not all this Prayer by heart: yet wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome I know is juſtified of her childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Let the truth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beget my Apologie, and you ſhall finde that my travels will not be intended in vaine. To ſpeake the truth then, there bee foure things that move mee to undergoe this Theame.
<list>
                     <item>1. Time and the preſent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</item>
                     <item>2. Your neceſſities.</item>
                     <item>3. The dignity of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</item>
                     <item>4. The perfection of the worke.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, the time and preſent opportunity leads us to it; for wee have beene buſied theſe many dayes in manifeſting to you the eſtate of your miſery by nature; the eſtate of grace to which you are exalted; the truth of God confirming the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20885:12"/> Covenant of his Grace, by the ſeale thereof, his Sacrament. And the recompence thereof in the duty we owe him for the manifeſtation of that his rich grace unto us. In the firſt we have a lamentable ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of our owne weakneſſe. In the ſecond and third wee have had a view of Gods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved love. In the laſt wee have had a taſte given us of the bounden duty we owe to God, for that his ſo rich and underſerved a favour made manifeſt unto us. The conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of al theſe premiſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyntly knit together, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us to the knees of our ſoules, by praier to ſay, <hi>Da do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine quod petis, &amp; pete quod vis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, beſides the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the oportunity of the time: your neceſſities doe not a little perſwade mee to this courſe; for howſoever we live in the middeſt of a cleare
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20885:13"/> and ſo uncontrouled a light, that no fleſh can bee excuſed by reaſon of ignorance; yet I muſt be bold, as the Servant of God (not daring to belie his truth) to ſay, that the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of this age is, that light hath ſhined into it, and yet your darkneſſe is palpable, and that you have loved darkneſſe better than light, becauſe your workes are evill.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the dignity of the Author of this Prayer, being duly conſidered, will not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle breed your reſpect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard thereof: For as it was ſaid of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, that amongſt the ſonnes of women a greater than hee did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe; ſo it ſhall be more truely ſaid of the Author of this Prayer, Amongſt the ſonnes of men there can bee found none ſo great as he. <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt man was great, made to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God; <hi>Enoch</hi> was great
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20885:13"/> and walked with God; <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was great and walked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; <hi>Salomon</hi> was great, and was called the ſonne of God; for it is written, <hi>I will bee his father, and hee ſhall bee my ſonne:</hi> but amongſt all theſe none was anſwerable to the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> to the true heire of <hi>David,</hi> to the true <hi>Salomon;</hi> yea to him, who ſpeaking of himſelfe was bold to affirme, <hi>A greater then Salomon is here:</hi> for he is not onely the Image of the inviſible God as <hi>Adam,</hi> nor walked hee with God as <hi>Enoch,</hi> nor before God as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham;</hi> but hee was the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Sonne of the eternal God, in whom the fulneſſe of the Godhead did bodily dwell, that out of his fulneſſe wee might receive grace and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and grace for grace. If then the ſervant bee not above his Maſter, nor the Diſciple above his Lord, who amongſt the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20885:14"/> ſons of men ſhall be his paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel, who was God of himſelf, Sonne of the Father, Man of the Holy Ghoſt, God and Man in one perſon: God, that he might ſatisfie; and Man, that hee might ſuffer for man, that man might be againe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to the glorious liberty of the ſonnes of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, ſhall we looke to the perfection of the worke it ſelfe? how can it bee but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, being the worke of him who is not onely perfect, but perfection it ſelfe? It is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Plinius</hi> in his <hi>lib.</hi> 35. <hi>cap.</hi> 10 that <hi>Apelles</hi> upon a time ſeeing a Tablature of <hi>Protogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> wherein for a Maſter-piece he had onely drawne a line of ſuch fineneſſe &amp; ſubtilitie, that in his opinion none could match it: <hi>Apelles</hi> taking the Penſell in hand, within the bounds of the ſame very line, drew another more ſubtil than
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20885:14"/> the firſt, that <hi>Protogines</hi> at his returne eſpying it, was forced to ſay, <hi>Niſi in Apellem non potu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it cadere tam abſolutum opus:</hi> So may I juſtly ſay of the worke and frame of this ſo excellent a Prayer, that ſave from the hands of the Sonne of God, ſo neate and accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed a worke could not have beene produced; and that both in reſpect of the brevity, of the plaineneſſe and perfection thereof. The brevity is cleare, for the words are few, and given unto us as an enchiridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in forme it is plaine, for in it there is no riddle, which any having the heyfer of the Spirit may not unfold: And finally, it is perfect, for in it there lacks nothing that can either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe our miſery, or reveale the riches of Gods mercy. Thus have I in theſe foure conſiderations cleared unto you the reaſon of my propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed intent.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:20885:15"/>
               <p>In handling of this Theame the Prayer ſhall be divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe three parts; a Preface, ſome Petitions, and a Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. This dayes taske ſhall lead us to conſider the Preface in theſe words, <hi>Our father which art in heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the underſtanding of the words, firſt, their infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; ſecondly, their tenour and matter. Their inference is one way reported by <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> another way by <hi>Luke: Matthew</hi> maketh it a part of his Sermon; <hi>Luke</hi> maketh it an anſwer or reference to a demand: whilſt <hi>Matthew</hi> coucheth it in the boſome of his ſermon, he maketh the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting grace of God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt; whilſt <hi>Luke</hi> maketh it a reference to a deſire, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us that the hungring and thirſting deſire of Gods Saints ſhall not goe away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied. The conſideration of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20885:15"/> the inference being paſt, wee come now to lay hold on the words of the Preface. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Preface to the Gate or entry of a building, and I think, not without reaſon: for as it is amongſt the ſonnes of men, whilſt they invite their fellowes or friends to their houſes, I doe verily thinke that without error they may receive them by three ſeverall courteſies; they may meet them at the gate and ſay, welcome friend; they may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them of the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of their company: and laſtly, if they have no ſuch fare as they would, they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe their friend at leaſt a good &amp; hanſome roome. In all theſe three you ſhall finde that our God doth prevent us, for he meets us at the doore, and tels us, that he is not onely our friend, but what is more, our father: if we be ceremonious
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20885:16"/> and enquire concerning the company, hee anſwers, there are none within but thoſe who are ours; and therefore it is written, <hi>Our father,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that of Chriſt Ieſus, <hi>I goe to my Father and to your Father, and to my God and your God.</hi> And laſt of all, if we ſhall be loath to enter, he will yet further ſatisfie us, by aſſuring us of the hanſomneſſe of the roomes; for the houſe is not a houſe made with hands, but a houſe that is glorious and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in the heavens, yea farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove theſe viſible heavens, the dwelling place of God, yea, the Heaven of Heavens.</p>
               <p>The firſt word of invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, <hi>Father.</hi> That we may the better know that God is our father, we muſt doe as thoſe, who not daring to looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sunne in his ſtrength, doe uſually call for a veſſell ful of water, wherein they may
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20885:16"/> boldly behold his Image without dazeling of their eyes: ſo we cannot fully know how God is our father, unleſſe wee looke on our earthly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and from them draw ſome weake reſemblance of the expreſſion, ſo farre as a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite creature may expreſſe an infinite Creatour. To under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this, amongſt the ſons of men there bee three ſorts of fathers, naturall, civill, and ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtique. A naturall father is he of whom wee have our naturall being, from whoſe loynes wee are powred out like milke, and of whoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance we are crowded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like Cheeſe. The civill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are thoſe Magiſtrates whom God hath ſet in place and preferment above us; and of thoſe it is ſaid, <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother.</hi> The Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticke fathers are the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Preachers of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20885:17"/> word, by whom (as being the Inſtruments of Gods worke) the life of God is begotten in our ſoules; and of this ſort it is that the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>Though you have many fathers, yet I have begotten you to bee the ſonnes of God by the Goſpell.</hi> Now, all of theſe wayes God is our father: our naturall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by creation, our civill fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by providence and ſuſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, our ſpirituall and ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticke father by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>option.</p>
               <p>God from the beginning of time hath beene the father of mankinde, but the nearer it drew to the fulneſſe of time, he became the nearer and the dearer father unto us. He was <hi>Adams</hi> father, &amp; was knowne to him by his name <hi>Gnaliion,</hi> The moſt high, a comfort anſwerable to <hi>Adams</hi> fall: He was <hi>Abrahams</hi> father, and knowne to him by his name
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20885:17"/> 
                  <hi>El-ſhaddai,</hi> The all-ſufficient; and this was a corroborative againſt <hi>Abrahams</hi> doubting: Hee was <hi>Moſes</hi> father, and knowne to him by his name <hi>Iehovah,</hi> which ſignified a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for in his time hee begun to give a being to his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made to <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iaco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>:</hi> under this name he was knowne to the Iudges, Kings, and Prophets of Iſrael; but when the fulneſſe of time came, God ſent his owne Son made of a woman, and made under the law, and to him hee is made knowne by the name of a Father, <hi>This is my beloved Sonne;</hi> and in him our Father alſo; his by nature, ours by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption: as it is written, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you are ſonnes, God hath ſent the ſpirit of his Sonne in your hearts, whereby you cry Abba, Father:</hi> And againe, <hi>To as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as come to him hee gave this prerogative, to bee called the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20885:18"/> ſonnes of the living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The knowledge of this (that God is our father) teacheth us foure things; affection, faith, obedience, and true under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
               <p>Firſt, affection; for now I pray not to a ſevere Iudge, nor to a cruell Tyrant, nor to a mercileſſe ſtranger, but by the contrary, to my kind and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious father, who knoweth my neede before I aske, and prevents my ſuite by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; for he meeteth me, kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth me, clotheth me, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the fat Calfe for me.</p>
               <p>Secondly, faith; for what will a kinde father refuſe to his begging child? The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſay</hi> telleth us, 49.15. <hi>Although our father that begot us ſhould forget us, and our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould not remember us as the fruit of her wombe, yet I will not forget thee, for I have gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee on the palmes of my
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20885:18"/> hands, and thy vowes are alwayes in my ſight.</hi> Let us therfore goe boldly to the Throne of grace, we ſhall ſurely bee heard in that which wee feare: for as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> telleth us, <hi>Dum ex malo ſervo factus ſum filius, prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicare quid acceperim fides eſt non arrogantia, non eſt ſuperbia ſed devotio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, obedience: For whilſt hee ſheweth himſelfe our mercifull father, hee tyeth us to be dutifull children, elſe even then when wee call him father, if wee doe not intend a filiall obedience, in ſtead of a father we provoke him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our Iudge, as ſitters in the chaire of the ſcorner: for it is written, <hi>If I be your father, where is my honour? and if I be your maſter, where is my feare? for there is mercy with me onely that I may be feared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, true underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of two things.

                  <p>IN our laſt Sermon wee loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on the perſon upon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wee call, in that reference, wherein wee call him <hi>Father.</hi> We come now to ſee by what reaſon we call him, <hi>Our.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That wee may underſtand this the better, know this I pray you, that our Redeemer Chriſt Ieſus comming into the world, not for himſelfe, nor for his owne ſake, but for us and ours, who were by our ſinnes eſtranged from him, hee hath taken our burden upon him, that by his ſuper-abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſatisfaction our ranſome might be fully ſatisfied; and by the blood of his Croſſe all things might be reconciled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the Father, even all things in heaven and in earth.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20885:20"/> But becauſe there is nothing done by God in time, which was not preordained to bee done before time, That Chriſt Ieſus ſhould bee our head in time, could never have beene duely accompliſhed, unleſſe before time he had beene pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained to be our head, and we the fellow members of his body: Now as in the fulneſſe of time he came in our fleſh to be our head, ſo here by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample he teacheth us how to carry our ſelves as dutifull and decent members of his body. The truth of this is cleare out of all theſe Petitions which Chriſt hath regiſtred to us in his Word; before hee ſuffered in <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. when hee ſuffered, when hee roſe againe and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended. In this hee was our true high Prieſt, carrying our names into the holy place, and there preparing a place for us, that where he is, there we may
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20885:20"/> be alſo. The Vnion therefore of the which he was ordained to be the head before all time, made him carefull in time to recollect and gather together the loſt and ſtraying members of his incorporatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and by his example teacheth us not onely to adhere to him by faith as our head, but alſo by love to adhere to others as members of one body.</p>
                  <p>But thou wilt ſay to mee, O man, where in doth this Vnion conſiſt, or how ſhall I know if I have part in this Vnion?</p>
                  <p>For anſwer hereto, let mee tell thee O man: What was before the world but Vnion? what is in the world but Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? what ſhall bee after the world but Vnion? Before the world nothing but Vnion, one God in Eſſence, although di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed in Perſons: in the world nothing but union, the heavens giving light, the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20885:21"/> clouds giving raine, the fire giving heate, the windes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving breath and refreſhment: after the world what ſhall bee but union? <hi>Gather my Saints to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from the foure Corners of the world, that there may bee but one ſhepheard and one ſheepfold, and that may be over all, and in all:</hi> yet becauſe this doth not ſatisfie the queſtion, let us ſee where in our union with Chriſt doth conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>I anſwere, our union with him ſtandeth manifeſt in foure things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We have an union with him, which giveth us love.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By his union wee have Sympathie.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By his union we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By his union wee have a ſhare and fellowſhip in riches: I have ſaid, that by his union we have love, as the husband hath with the wife; wee have
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:20885:21"/> ſympathie, as the members have with the head; we have influence and ſappe, as the Branches have from the root; finally and we have a ſhare in riches three wayes, an union in his Eſſence, an union in his Office, and an union in his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. In his eſſence, for he that was God became man, that man might become the ſonne of God. In his office, for in him wee are made to the Father Kings, Prieſts, and Prophets. In his vertues, for hee of God was made to us wiſedome, righteouſneſſe, ſanctification, and redemption.</p>
                  <p>But that the words may be a little more cleare, let me tell you that the word <hi>Our,</hi> looks with a threefold aſpect; for our eyes are ſometimes exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed <hi>per viſionem reflexam,</hi> ſometimes <hi>per viſionem collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralem,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>per viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem tranſcendentem:</hi> Our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:20885:22"/> looke beholdeth our ſelves, and therefore wee ſay <hi>Ours,</hi> by application, for it is but a cold and miſerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to ſay ours, when we have no private application, like <hi>Thomas.</hi> The collaterall looke lookes on our brethren, either <hi>à dextris,</hi> in the ſonnes of Gods love, dealing with them in faith, hope and charity; or <hi>à ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtris,</hi> in the children of diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, pulling them out of the fire, or heaping coales of fire on their heads. The tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent look lookes on God himſelfe, who in Chriſt Ieſus is become our father, and wee his ſonnes.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt wee looke to the words with a reflected con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, we are taught hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; for we make great rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of our parentage, if it hath pleaſed God to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh us in any degree from beyond our brethren. Oh but
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20885:22"/> how fooliſh is our rejoycing, for there is nothing in nature that reſpecteth greatneſſe but man! not our bitth, not our ſife, not our ſickneſſe, not our death, not our grave; nothing in grace reſpects greatneſſe but man; not the preaching of the Word, for wee all doe heare; not our effectuall calling, for there are the things that are not preferred to the things that are; not our adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacraments, for by water we are baptized, and by a ſacramentall bread wee are fed: nothing in glory, for if this be a true poſition, that we muſt reape according to that which wee have ſowne, then he who ſoweth ſparingly ſhall reape ſparingly, and hee who ſoweth in plenty, ſhall reape in joy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whilſt we looke on our brethren <hi>viſione collaterali,</hi> if they bee of the houſhold of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:20885:23"/> faith, I meane the Church, and the members therof, ſee that thou rejoyce with them that rejoyce, and weepe with them that mourne, and remember the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are in bonds, as if we our ſelves were afflicted in the body; but eſpecially and above al, to mourne for the diviſions of <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> If they bee from without, brethren, I meane by nature, and not by grace; let us pity their miſery, with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence waite for their returne, and in ſincerity pray for their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>verſion; for howſoever it be not as yet ſeene to the world, that God is become their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Chriſt Ieſus, yet how ſoon it may be, we know not, for the time is at hand, wherin all Iſrael muſt be Iſrael. Whilſt we thinke therefore that wee ſtand, let us take heed that we fall not, and let us pray for their reſtitution, for we know not when wee our ſelves ſhall
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:20885:23"/> alſo be tempted. 3 Laſtly, whilſt we look on the words with a tranſcendent ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let us know aright from whom, &amp; by whom, we have the liberty of this prerogative, <hi>viz.</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus And let us labour to become his fellow brethren, that God may be our father in him: for having him wee have all things, and without him wee have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: for all things are ours whilſt wee are Chriſts, for Chriſt is Gods. I have heard talking of fraternity: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing of the begging Friers is vaine, they are <hi>fratres mendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantes:</hi> the rejoycing of the Jeſuites is vaine, they are <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres ſocietatis Ieſu,</hi> an arrogant fraternity: the rejoycing of the Chymeck, or judiciall Aſtrologues is vaine, they are <hi>Fratres roſeae-crucis,</hi> a fooliſh fraternity, for they evaniſh in the vanity of their imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:20885:24"/> No, no, there is no frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in the world anſwerable to a Chriſtian fraternity, wherein God doth become our father, for ſo wee have hope againſt all the feares of the naturall man, ſuch as, want, ſickneſſe, death, judgement, hell and Sathan.</p>

               <p>HEre it may be enquired, and not amiſſe, how it is, that the preſence of God is tyed to the heaven. Seeing hee is every where, ſo filling all things that hee is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended of nothing: and ſo without all things that hee is excluded of nothing. For an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer hereof, it is requiſite that wee know, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation of the preſence of God is manifold and diverſe: There is a generall, there is a particular, there is a perſonall, and there is a locall preſence
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20885:26"/> of God. By his generall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence hee is preſent with all his creatures: <hi>For in him wee live, wee move, and have our beeing.</hi> By his particular pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, he is preſent with man, and becauſe the ſonnes of men are of two ſorts, therefore the diſpenſation of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is twofold: with the child of diſobedience, hee is preſent by his providence, his power, and his juſtice: by his providence maintaining his life, by his power ordering his wayes to their appointed ends, and by his juſtice bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him up in the ſecret of his ſoule, with chaines of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the judgement of the great day: with the child of his free love he is preſent, by his providence maintaining his life, by his power keeping him that he daſh not his foot againſt a ſtone, and by his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy keeping him through faith
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20885:26"/> to eternall ſalvation. By his perſonall preſence, hee is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with his Sonne, the Lord Jeſus: by his locall preſence he is ſaid to bee in heaven, not that the heaven of heavens is able to containe him who is infinite, but that there chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he manifeſteth his glorious preſence, and his glorious eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, to the Angels, who have kept their originall inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, to the Soules of the Saints departed, and to all of us, both in ſoule and body, in the day of our laſt and finall refreſhment: In a word, God is ſaid to be in heaven, as the ſoule is ſaid to be in the head, or heart of man. The ſoule we know animates the whole body, and by her preſence in every member thereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth life thereto, yet by way of preheminencie, and excellencie, it is ſaid to be in the head, and in the heart of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:20885:27"/> man. Becauſe in theſe two parts, and from theſe two parts ſhee exerciſeth her chiefeſt fnnctions, &amp; commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth, and deriveth her chiefeſt influence: So is it with God, for howſoever by his infinite eſſence he be eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, and filleth all his creatures, yet by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminencie and excellencie, he is moſt ſpecially ſaid to be in heaven, becauſe there it is that the rayes and glorious beames of his Majeſtie are chiefly ſeene, and from thence it is, that he maketh the ſteps and impreſſions of his power knowne to the ſonnes of men: It is true indeed, wee can no where caſt our eyes on the creatures, but wee do ſtraight perceive the characters of his wiſdome, power, and Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie: For will we looke on the naturall courſe of the world, we ſee init foure ſeveral ſorts of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:20885:27"/> creatures: The firſt, bare, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and ſimple ſubſtances, without either life, ſenſe, or reaſon; of this ſort are the Heavens, the Sun, the Moone, and the Starres: The ſecond ſort have ſubſtance, and life, but not ſenſe or reaſon, ſuch are the trees, plants, &amp; herbs of the field; all which have a vegitative life, but no ſenſe, nor reaſon: The third ſort have life and ſenſe, but no reaſon, ſuch as the fowles of the aire, the beaſts of the field, and the fiſhes of the ſea. The fourth and laſt ſort hath all of theſe; ſubſtance, life, ſenſe, and reaſon, and that is man. Now every one of theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ſorts of creatures do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed one another, and ſerve one for anothers uſe: for wee ſee the firſt, which are but mere ſubſtances, ſerve for the uſe of them who have life. Theſe who have life do ſerve
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:20885:28"/> for the uſe of them who have reaſon; and man who hath reaſon, hee doth ſerve, hee ſhould ſerve, and ſhall ſerve for the uſe of that God, who dwelleth in the Heavens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>
               <p>Now, who can looke on the beauty of theſe creatures, Who can conſider the refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or who can contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate aright their correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but muſt ſtraight know, and confeſſe, both that there is a God, and that hee both made himſelfe viſible and palpable in his creatures, and yet that the full ſtreine of his glory is in Heaven? for here wee ſee but in part, wee know but in part, and all that we either can ſee, or know of him, is but imperfect: our perfection is hidden up with him in the Heavens, and when wee ſhall by his power be brought thither, wee then
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:20885:28"/> ſhall fully ſee him as wee are ſeene, and know him as wee are knowne, and be changed into his image from glory to glory, by the Spirit of the Lord.</p>
               <p>Now brethren, having laid this for a foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable; that howſoever the Lord is every where, yet chiefly hee is in heaven, the habitation of his holineſſe; and that howſoever hee be made viſible in all his creatures, yet the full and accompliſhed vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his glory wee ſhall not have, but in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens: It reſteth, that from the conſideration hereof, wee learne to make uſe of the ſame for our ſpirituall advantage.</p>
               <p>The uſe that wee make of this is threefold.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</label> Firſt; it teacheth us to whom we ſhould pray.</p>
               <p>Secondly, how wee ſhould pray.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:20885:29"/>
               <p>And thirdly, how wee ſhould live when wee have prayed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to whom ſhould wee pray, but to God, and to him who is in heaven? There are but two motives which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect man in the time of need to have his recourſe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for helpe: The firſt is affection, the ſecond is power: who but a foole will in the time of need run for helpe to any man, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (hee knoweth) doth not love him, for it is madneſſe for a man to become a ſuiter where love pleadeth not as a mediator: it is for this cauſe that Chriſt Jeſus our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer hath in the frontiſpice of this prayer given us the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Gods love to wards us, whilſt he calls him <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> that from the aſſurance of his fatherly love, wee may draw neere to the Throne of Grace with boldneſſe,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20885:29"/> and there poure out our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications before him, with aſſurance to be heard in that which we feare.</p>
               <p>The other motive why men in the time of need have their recourſe to another, is the aſſurance of his power: For though hee were never ſo wel affected, if he be not able, our petitions are all in vaine; The Lord liveth, let the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple tremble, hee ſits betwixt the Cherubins, let the Earth be moved, let the people ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine vaine things, and let the Kings of the earth aſſemble themſelves together, yet hee that dwelleth in the Heavens ſhall laugh them to ſcorne, and hee that is powerfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all gods ſhall have them in deriſion. The knowledge hereof is of great uſe, for the troubles of the righteous are many, and unleſſe that God was both willing and able to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:20885:30"/> deliver them, they of all men in the world ſhould bee the moſt miſerable: But bleſſed be God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, hee to whom wee runne for helpe, is both kinde to acknowledge us for his, and powerfull to deliver us: It was the knowledge hereof that made <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtrong in the faith, hee knew that hee who had promiſed was able to performe: It was this that wrought <hi>Nebuchadnezars</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; it was this that was the ground of the three Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens conſtancy; it was this on the which <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt</hi> built his rebuke; from this <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Paul</hi> did beate downe the vaine glory of the Gentile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Jew; and finally, it was this upon which the ſame Apoſtle built his perſevera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, <hi>I know whom I have beleeved, and that hee is able to keepe that which I have concreded unto
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:20885:30"/> him.</hi> Bleſſed is the man that in the time of need can build himſelfe, and the aſſurance of his deliverance on theſe two foundations, the unchangeable love of God, and his unreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power! ſurely that man hath built himſelfe upon a rocke, againſt which the gates of hell cannot prevaile: But woe be to him who draweth neere unto God, &amp; doubteth in any of theſe points: ſurely, that mans glory ſhall bee ſhaken, and his beſt refuge ſhall prove but a broken reed, or a houſe built on the ſand, whoſe fall ſhall be both great and irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable.</p>
               <p>The ſecond that wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke from the words, is, How wee ſhould pray: And that is with a diſtance, for God is in the heavens, and we are upon the earth: It is fitting therefore that our words ſhould be few: I have
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20885:31"/> many times told you from this place, that the children and ſonnes of men doe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede and hinder the ſucceſſe of their prayers, ſo as when we aske we receive not, when we ſeeke wee finde not, and when we knocke, it is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto us: But the fault is not with God, it is alwaies with us, for ſometimes wee doe erre in the matter of our prayers, preferring the things of this life, to thoſe of the life to come: ſometimes in the manner of our prayer, begging pardon, when our crying ſins prevaile: Sometimes in the time of prayer, whilſt we call upon him in the time of our calamitie whom we forget in the day of our proſperitie: But chiefely we impede the ſucceſſe of our prayers, and hinder their due correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, when our approaches are void of due conſideration
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20885:31"/> and diſtance. It is wonderfull to ſee what reſpect &amp; diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is obſerved amongſt the ſons of me: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we enter into the courts of Princes, wee come no ſooner within the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence chamber, but ſtraight we are uncovered; and give wee preſent, a petition, or ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is done with a bended knee, and reaſon too: for true Majeſtie requireth true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: There is a diſtance obſerved betwixt the noble and ignoble, betwixt the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſonne, betwixt the maſter and ſervant, betwixt the rich and poore, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the wiſe man and the foole: And ſhall there be no diſtance kept betwixt God and man? God a mighty, ſtrong, immortall, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Eſſence: Man a poore, miſerable, weake, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible creature.</p>
               <p>O man wouldſt thou have
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20885:32"/> thy prayer heard: come ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the preſence of that dreadfull Majeſtie, but with feare and trembling, for he is in the Heaven, and thou art but on earth, yea a worme of the earth: The Heavens are not pure enough in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and hee hath found no ſtedfaſtneſſe in his very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: How much more abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable art thou before him, whoſe Tabernacle is in the duſt, whoſe dwelling is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed before the moath and the worme, and who continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally drinketh up iniquity like water? but, out upon the lourde and abominable miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of this time: It is long ere we can be awaked to come to this houſe of prayer, our pinnes and dreſſings are ſo many: And when wee come, oh! with what unreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence doe wee preſent our ſelves before that dreadfull
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:20885:32"/> Majeſtie: In a moment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſideration wee clappe downe upon our knees, wee mumble out ſome weak faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted &amp; miſcaryed thoughts before him, &amp; we are no ſooner ſet thus on work, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtraight our eyes are gazing on our neighbors, &amp; our hearts carried captive with the vanities and cares of the time, ſo that in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect we turn the houſe of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to a den of theevs. Alas my brethren, theſe things ought not to be ſo, we doe not learn this at our fellow Brethren, <hi>Abraham, David, Gedion, and the Virgin Mary.</hi> We did not learne this at Chriſt himſelfe, for in the daies of his fleſh, he offered up ſtrong cryes and ſupplications: wee doe not learne this at the holy Angels, who ſtand before him: nor at thoſe crowned Kings, who caſt their Crownes at his feet: No, no, all of theſe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:20885:33"/> their unworthineſſe, and pondering the ſame with his incomparable glory, they lick the duſt before him: But wee out of the ſenſeleſſe ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of our ſoules, have ſaid, wee are rich, and increaſed with goods, and that we doe ſtand in need of nothing, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that wee bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together poore &amp; wretched, naked and blinde. The Lord open our eyes to ſee the true diſtance that is betwixt the heaven and the earth, and in the due conſideration thereof to carry our ſelves anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: For when wee ſhall bee truly better then wee are, is it ſhall be our beſt to think leaſt of our ſelves and more of him, and to give him his due ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor in our greateſt abaſement.</p>
               <p>The third and laſt thing is: how we ſhould live and carry our ſelves before him when we have prayed: and this alſo
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20885:33"/> is very worthy of our remark it is our cuſtome for the moſt part, in the ſenſe of our ſinne to runne to God and to cry for mercy: But wee can no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſay, Lord forgive us our ſinnes, when ſtraight with the dogge wee returne to the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of our iniquities, and with the ſowe to the puddle of our tranſgreſſions: and what elſe is this I pray you, but a ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of God, and in effect a begging of his leave to ſinne againſt him; what a prayer is this? Doth the ſchoole man pardon the ignorance of his ſcholler, that he may afreſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne and play the trowant? or doth the Maſter of a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly winke at the deboarding of his ſervant, that he may of new play the wagge? No ſure, it is to another purpoſe, that they manifeſt their mercy: wilt thou O man be angry with thy contempt, and ſhall
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:20885:34"/> not hee who chaſtiſeth the Nations, correct? No, no, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not thy ſelfe, he whom thou calleſt thy father, and whoſe habitation thou doſt confeſſe to be in heaven, ſhall laugh thy project to ſcorne: for he deſireth not thy ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nor thy burnt offerings, he abhorreth thy ſolemne feaſts, and thy new Moones: All that he requireth of thee is a new borne creature, for a broken and contrite heart the Lord never deſpiſed. Woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou then have thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to bee heard? I pray thee take heed to whom thou prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt: if thou invokeſt thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is in heaven, let thy converſation be with him alſo in heaven, and remember that counſell given by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to the Coloſſians: <hi>If you bee riſen with Ieſus Chriſt, ſeeke thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth at
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:20885:34"/> the right hand of the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thou wilt ſay to me, O man, how ſhall I ſeek thoſe things that are above, ſince they are unſearchable? the eye hath not ſeene them, the care hath not heard them, and the minde of man cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them? I may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere with the Apoſtle in that ſame place, Though thy hand be ſhort that thou canſt not reach to them, yet thy heart and the deſires thereof are not ſo: Set thy affections (ſaith the Apoſtle) upon them. But for the more particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, I will teach thee how to attaine unto them. If thou wouldeſt ſeeke thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is in heaven, and in ſeeking, finde him, then bee carefull of three things:</p>
               <p>Seeke him where hee may be found, ſeeke him how hee may be found, and ſeeke him whilſt he may be found. It is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20885:35"/> a lamentable pity to ſee the toile and travaile of men in this time: for they weary themſelves in ſearching and ſeeking out the heavens, the ayre, the ſea, the earth, and when they have found them, the more that they know of them the greater fooles they become: As it is written <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. O but that induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſearch that hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ſatisfaction and true content is only to ſeeke God and his Heavenly kingdome: To the atchievement whereof wee muſt firſt ſeeke him where he may bee found, and where is that I pray you? <hi>Gregory</hi> in his moralls <hi>lib.</hi> 16. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. telleth us, <hi>In Sinu ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris Eccleſiae.</hi> Not in <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Dennis</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> not in <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Iaques</hi> or <hi>Compoſtella</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> not in <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Patricks Purgatory</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> nor at the holy Grave in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem: No, no, if at any time
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:20885:35"/> he was found there made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt unto them, hee hath now withdrawue his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to the Heavens. And out upon their folly that weary themſelves in ſeeking him by ſuch ſublunary Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages: I may and will bee bold juſtly to ſay what the Angells ſaid to <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len: Why ſeekeſt thou the living amongst the dead?</hi> But if thou wouldeſt ſeeke him, ſeek him in his Church, in the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his word, in the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of his Sacraments; and in the ſweet Quire of the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and prayers of his <hi>Saints:</hi> And ſurely if thou findeſt him not there in the ſmell of his garments, thou ſhalt never finde him in the fulneſſe of his glory: For it ſhall be with all of us, as it was with the two Diſciples going to <hi>Emaus,</hi> whilſt hee talked with them, and opened unto them the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:20885:36"/> Scriptures, their hearts did burne within them by the way: It ſhall bee ſo (I ſay) with thee O man: if thou get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt not thy heart inflamed with a ſparke of his love in the way, when thou heareſt his word, it is a fearefull teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that thou ſhalt not bee ſatisfied with the fulneſſe of his joy in the life to come: For it is the ſweet ſmelling reliſh of thoſe drops that we get in his word, that maketh us to follow after him, and with our heart to pant and pray till wee ſee him in Sion that is inviſible.</p>
               <p n="2">2 As wee muſt ſeeke him where hee may bee found, ſo wee muſt alſo ſeeke him whilſt he may be found; For there is a time appointed for all things under the Sunne. A due time, wherein if we ſeeke we ſhall finde, and a prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous time, wherein although
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:20885:36"/> we knocke, it ſhall not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto us. This precious time is to day, for to day wee muſt heare his voice: This is the acceptable time, this is the day of our viſitation. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Eſau,</hi> the <hi>Fooliſh vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> and the <hi>Spouſe</hi> in the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Laſtly, let us ſeeke him how he may be found: and as for this, know that though he be ſought of many, yet hee is found but of a few, becauſe that they ſeeke him not after this faſhion: For hee that would finde God muſt ſeeke foure manner of wayes, ſaith <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Caſte &amp; unice,</hi> for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his owne ſake, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king nothing but in him, and for him, knowing that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of this world periſheth</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Verè &amp; ſine hypocriſi,</hi> truly and without diſſimulation: For if wee draw neere him
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:20885:37"/> with our mouthes, when our hearts are farre from him, he will caſt backe the duſt of our ſacrifices upon our faces, and make open our nakedneſſe in the ſight of our enemies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Fervidè &amp; cum zelo.</hi> For the Kingdome of heaven ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth violence, and the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent take it perforce, and if our prayers want audience, it is becauſe they want heart.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Perſeverantèr &amp; conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuo.</hi> For it had been better for us never to have knowne the way of truth, then after that wee have knowne it, that we ſhould looke backe with <hi>Lots Wife,</hi> or deſire a returne with <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the <hi>Fleſh-pots</hi> of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now Brethren, I hope I have made the firſt part of this prayer cleere unto you in ſome condition: For in it I have ſhewed you the love of the inviter, God, who is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20885:37"/> Our Father: I have ſhewed you the communion and fellowſhip of your ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they are all our owne Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Siſters, yea fellow members with us, of that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall body, whereof Jeſus Chriſt is the Glorious head.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I have ſhewed you the Glory of the habitation to which wee are invited, it is the heaven of heavens where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he dwelleth that is al-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. What now reſteth, but as thoſe parts have beene ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally touched, and in them, you inſtructed: So now for concluſion, we binde them up againe, and learne you in a compoſed frame to ſay aright <hi>Our Father which art in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> And to the effect you may doe ſo, and bee heard in ſo doing, let mee requeſt you for Gods ſake to follow his counſell who hath directed you thus to pray: Whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:20885:38"/> thou commeſt before God to intreat him as thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heaven, learn to deny thy ſelfe, and to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him: Deny thy ſelfe, for thou art altogether unſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and follow after him, for in him doth all fulneſſe dwell. Thou art inſufficient in a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold reſpect.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In reſpect of Judgement to reſolve aright.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In reſpect of wiſedome, to mannage aright</p>
               <p n="3">3. And in reſpect of power to bring to paſſe.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of Judgement, for we are blinde, and know not the things of God.</p>
               <p>In reſpect of wiſedome to mannage, for with <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> wee are in bringing up the Arke, and therefore many times our <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth.</p>
               <p>In regard of power, to bring to paſſe things that are
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20885:38"/> ſpirituall, wee can neither will nor performe; For <hi>Paul</hi> may plant and <hi>Apollos</hi> water, but God giveth the increaſe. And as we muſt deny our ſelves, ſo we muſt alſo follow him, becauſe of his ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, for hee is all-ſufficient, in his mercy, in his wiſedome, in his power, and in his truth.</p>
               <p>In mercy, for where our ſinne abounded, his mercy hath ſuperabounded.</p>
               <p>In wiſedome, for hee hath ſo wiſely reconciled his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to his Juſtice that hee is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and wee ſaved.</p>
               <p>In his power, for he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the heavens, and doth on the earth whatſoever hee willeth.</p>
               <p>In his truth, for heaven and earth ſhall paſſe away, but one jot of his word falleth not to the ground: If we ſeeke him he will bee found of us, but if we forſake him, he wil forſake us too.</p>

               <p>AFter the Preface, wee come in order to looke to the Petitions, which are ſix, whereof three have a refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to God, and three unto man, and his humane weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: In handling of theſe Petitions, this ſhall God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling be the path wherein wee ſhall walke. Wee will firſt looke to the order of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, and ſee in what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it ſtandeth with the reſt. And then wee will look upon the matter conteined in the Petition, and ſee wherin it doth concerne us. The order of this Petition is cleere and eaſie, for if theſe three Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which concerne God bee juſtly preferred to thoſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:20885:39"/> which concerne man, then of neceſſity that Petition which doth moſt truly point out Gods honor unto us ſhould firſt have place: and that is this. For it doth moſt lively repreſent unto us the care of Gods glory: To it therefore precedency is duly given. Now that this may be a little more cleere, I ſhall labour to give you the evidence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, both from the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and the practiſe of his Saints. Shall we looke to the commandement of God? it is more then manifeſt; for amongſt thoſe ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements which hee gave to Iſrael, the firſt foure which concerne himſelfe, are prefixed to thoſe other ſixe which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne but us: And amongſt theſe foure, that which doth moſt eminently and evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet forth his Glory, hath both preheminency and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:20885:40"/> of place. Anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto this, is that directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſts, <hi>Matthew</hi> 6.33. <hi>Seeke firſt the Kingdome of God and the righteouſneſſe thereof, and the things of this life ſhall be caſt unto you.</hi> As God by the authoritie of his word, doth require this of us: So alſo at all times it hath beene the practiſe of his <hi>Saints,</hi> in whom the Spirit of God hath dwelt powerfully, ever to preferre the Glory of God, to all things in this life, yea to their owne life it ſelfe. Looke to the practiſe of <hi>Moſes, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus</hi> 32. And of <hi>Paul</hi> that elect veſſell of Mercy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3. Both of them in a burning zeale to the honor of God, did wiſh themſelves to bee thruſt out from God, that in their overthrow, his honor might bee the more manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted. Let me yet adde to this another conſideration of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:20885:40"/> order: and we ſhall ſee that it is not without reaſon that this Petition hath the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency. For in it I finde a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull ſtrain of the wiſedom of our Redeemer Chriſt Jeſus. In the preface and entry of this prayer, he hath led us to direct our Petitions in the termes of affection, in the termes of faith, and in the termes of feare: In the termes of affection, whilſt we call God a Father: In the termes of faith, whilſt we call him our Father, and by faith make him to be ours in Chriſt Jeſus: And in the termes of feare, whilſt we acknowledge his power in heaven and in earth: And then being to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our Petitions, either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the riches of Gods mercy, or to the depth of our miſery: The firſt thing that we are deſired to crave of God is a heart, that can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:20885:41"/> of his Glory: For it is impoſſible that wee ſhould at any time walke in the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſucceeding Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, unleſſe that our hearts be firſt inflamed with the zeale of Gods glory: For if wee conſider aright, who is hee that can ingeniouſly ſay, let <hi>thy Kingdome come,</hi> or <hi>thy will be done on earth,</hi> unleſſe he bee firſt enamored with the love of Gods glory? Or who is hee that can content himſelfe with his <hi>Daily bread,</hi> or hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt for the <hi>Pardon of his ſinnes,</hi> or ſtrive and wreſtle againſt <hi>Temptation,</hi> who hath not his heart inflamed with the ſparkes of the Glory of God? ſurely amongſt the ſons of men there ſhall not bee found one, no not one. For we are here, <hi>In via, non in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria. Viatores, non co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehenſores.</hi> And therefore it is impoſſible for us to deſire the reparation
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:20885:41"/> of the loſt image of God in us, or to make a right uſe of the things of this naturall life, unleſſe God illuminate our eyes, and inflame us with the love of his glory, who dwells in glory, and hath cloathed himſelfe with glory inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, which no fleſh can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and live. That the Jewes ſhould have had a chiefe care of this glory, it was well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated unto them in the motto of their High Prieſts, that was on their frontlets: <hi>Sanctitas Iehovae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The High-prieſt was glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous every way, in the lower hemne of his garment, hee had a fringe interlaced with bells, and pomegranats of gold: in his breſtplate he had the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim,</hi> and the <hi>Thummim:</hi> on his ſhoulders hee had two Onix ſtones: but on his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head (as one conſecrated to the ſervice of God) hee had
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:20885:42"/> engraven <hi>Holineſſe to the Lord.</hi> Wherein hee did both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe and petition: confeſſe that God was holy, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it ſelfe: and petition him that he would make him holy as he was who had called him: and as the Jewe was thus inſtructed, ſo alſo are we who are Gentiles, not left without inſtruction. For I muſt ſay here of this petition what <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke of faith, hope, and charity, in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of charity to the other two, hee giveth a reaſon: Thoſe two ſhall evaniſh, but charity ſhall convey us to the Kingdome of heaven. So fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it with this petition: the reſt ſhall all ſo evaniſh: <hi>Thy kingdome come</hi> ſhall ceaſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to us by death: <hi>Thy will be done in earth</hi> ſhall ceaſe, when wee ſhall reſt from our labours, and our workes ſhall follow us. <hi>Give us this day our
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:20885:42"/> daily bread</hi> ſhall ceaſe, when wee ſhall eate of the bread of life. <hi>Forgive us our ſinnes</hi> ſhall ceaſe, when wee ſhall enter into our Maſters joy. <hi>Lead us not into temptation</hi> ſhall ceaſe, when God ſhall tread death, ſinne, and ſathan under our feete. Thus an end of all theſe petitions ſhall come, only this one ſhall have no end at all: but ſhall be like to him, to whom it is here aſcribed: for hee in himſelfe is A and Ω, the firſt, and the laſt; ſo ſhall his honour and glory bee alſo like unto him: a new ſong hee ſhall put into our mouth, and a deepe <hi>Hallelujah</hi> in the ſecret of our hearts, wherein the heavens and the earth, and the hoaſts thereof, ſhall onely reſound the praiſe, the power and the glory of God, for whom, and by whom all things were made; to him bee glory for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:20885:43"/>
               <p>Now after the order let us come to the words of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition. It hath three things conſiderable in it. Firſt, a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; ſecondly, an attribute; thirdly, and a word of copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, tying the Attribute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Subject. The Subject is Gods <hi>name:</hi> the Attribute is in the word <hi>Hallowed:</hi> The tye of copulation is <hi>Thy:</hi> To ſpeake ſomewhat more fully of this purpoſe, it ſhall not be amiſſe to follow the order ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the civill, or common law: both of them referre the whole body or bulke of of their law to theſe three: <hi>Ad Perſonas, Res, &amp; Actiones, Iuſtin. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Inſtit. titulo</hi> 2. <hi>in fine. Lancelot. inſtitut. Iure Canon. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Titus.</hi> 3. <hi>in fine.</hi> Pardon mee a little to invert their order, and it ſhall ſerve for the better illuſtration of our matter.</p>
               <p>In handling of this petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:20885:43"/> three things are to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: ſome things, ſome acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſome perſons in peculiar.</p>
               <p>The thing propoſed is Gods name.</p>
               <p>The action concerning it, is, the fanctifying, or hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof.</p>
               <p>The peculiar perſon, whoſe name ſhould be ſanctified, is Gods name, beyond all other name, or things in heaven, in earth, or under the earth.</p>
               <p>Let us now come to the Subject of this Petition: Gods name. For underſtanding here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, know; that names of things are the notes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of the true bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, and ſerve to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent unto our underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the true knowledge of the things themſelves by the aſſiſtance of voice and aire.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:20885:44"/> This is cleare by the denomination of all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God: for as the folly of a foole is knowne in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more, then in denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating of things amiſſe: ſo is the wiſdome of man knowne in nothing more, then in the true denomination of things, preſented before him: This being the ſole, and abſolute difference betwixt them, that as a thing doth give eſſence to the name, ſo the name giveth a declaration of the thing. <hi>Res eſt nominis ratio, nomen eſt rei ſignu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> But leſt in ſtead of play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the divine, I ſhould ſeeme to play the Philoſopher, let mee ſhew you that names are of three ſorts. Firſt, ſome give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the creatures by man. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſome given to man by God. Thirdly, ſome given and aſcribed by God to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>I ſay firſt, ſome names were given to Gods creatures by
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:20885:44"/> 
                  <hi>Adam:</hi> for it is written, <hi>As Adam called every living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo was the name thereof:</hi> This was a part of that image of God imprinted in <hi>Adam</hi> in the beginning, that as the Parent, the Maſter, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour of all Gods creatures, he impoſed names unto them, yet was not this his ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty abſolute, but ſubordinate: for though the name was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams,</hi> yet the workemanſhip was Gods: God made the creatures, <hi>Adam</hi> onely was the godfather unto them: and therefore wee ſee, that <hi>Adam</hi> who gave a name to every creature, yet did not aſſume a name to himſelfe: hee named the creatures, but God named him, and called him <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſay, that as man gave names to the creatures, ſo God giveth a name to man: as is evident, not onely in that which he gave to <hi>Adam,</hi> and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:20885:45"/> 
                  <hi>Evah</hi> his chiefe creatures, but alſo in thoſe which hee hath ſometimes given to men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came from their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers belly: as to <hi>Cyrus, Ioſiah, Iohn the Baptiſt,</hi> and to <hi>Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> and in thoſe names which hee did change from a naturall to a ſpirituall ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: as <hi>Abram</hi> to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Sarai</hi> to <hi>Sarah, Iacob</hi> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Ieconiah</hi> to <hi>Coniah:</hi> ſhewing us, that as our parent, our Maſter, and our Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, he both gives and changes names unto us at his pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſay, God taketh a name to himſelfe: for ſince names are but the ſignification of things that are, and of that which they are; none can give a name to God, becauſe none doth know what hee is: for he is infinite, and wee finite, he is incomprehenſible, and all our judgement may bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized within a ſpanne, onely
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20885:45"/> he himſelfe, who hath his bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himſelfe, and giveth a beeing to all things that are, can of himſelfe, and by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe declare what hee is, and make his name knowne unto man: according to that which is written, <hi>No man hath ſeene the Father at any time, ſave the Sonne, who is in the boſome of the Father; neither hath any man knowne the Father ſave the Son, and hee to whom the Sonne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veales him.</hi> And now this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpoken in generall concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning names: it reſts that wee looke in particular to the name of God. And if any ſhall aske the meaning thereof, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that three things are ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by it: his eſſence, his workes, and his word: for the name of God is two wayes taken in Scripture. Firſt, eſſentially, ſecondly, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Eſſentially, it is taken for himſelfe, as in the 20. <hi>Pſal.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:20885:46"/> The name of the God of Iacob defend thee,</hi> that is to ſay, the God of <hi>Iacob</hi> defend thee. And againe, 10. <hi>Ro. Whoſoever ſhall call on the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved:</hi> that is, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall call on the Lord: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively, the name of God in Scripture is three wayes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; for his attributes, his workes, and his words: For his attributes, of juſtice, or of mercy; looke to <hi>Pharaoh: I will get my ſelfe a name of him.</hi> The ſecond relation of it is to his word, and the truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and of this it is ſaid, that <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was the place which hee had choſen for his name: for as the Law was given from <hi>Sinai,</hi> ſo the grace of the Goſpell went firſt out from <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And laſtly, his name is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to his workes: for ſo is it written: <hi>God is knowne in Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, and in Iudah hee hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:20885:46"/> his name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</label> Now having in ſome meaſure delineated unto you, him that is inviſible: not as he is knowne of us, but as he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſteth himſelfe unto us in his attributes, his word, and his workes, let us ſtay a little, and draw from thence ſome comfort to our owne ſoules: which ſurely is here in great meaſure to bee found: for whilſt wee looke on the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the revelation, how God hath made himſelfe known to us by his name: who is hee that cannot, nor will not infinitely rejoyce therein? For it is true indeed, that many times, and in divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, God made himſelfe knowne to the world of old: yet all were but clouds in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of our light, all was darkneſſe in reſpect of our day, and all were but ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows in reſpect of that ſweet
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:20885:47"/> Sun-ſhine that hath now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto us in Jeſus Chriſt his Sonne; in whom hee hath made his name fully knowne, and to whom in our fleſh hee hath given a name farre above every name that is named: that at the name of Jeſus made manifeſt in our fleſh, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very knee ſhould bow, both of things that are in heaven and in earth.</p>
               <p>But thou wilt inquire of me (O man) Did not God make himſelfe knowne by his name to <hi>Adam,</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to <hi>Abraham, Iſaack, Iacob,</hi> and the Prophets: And by theſe his names, point out to them the fulneſſe of his grace in Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>I anſwer thee, It is true indeed but the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is great: for God in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting of his name unto us, hath now done it more neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, more cleerely, more fully,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:20885:47"/> and more familiarly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, more neerly: for what is neerer to us then our nature, which he did aſſume, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came fleſh of our fleſh, and bone of our bone, yea like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us in all things ſinne onely excepted, that wee might bee made to God in him, fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone in a ſpirituall regeneration.</p>
               <p>Secondly, more clearely: for they ſaw but darkly, and under a veile, but wee have ſeene him in the prime, and ſtrength of his light: for it is written, <hi>All theſe things were but ſhadowes of things to come, but the body was Chriſt Ieſus. Galat.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, more fully: for he hath kept back no part of the counſell of the Father from us, which was neceſſary to our ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, more familiarly: for what could be more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:20885:48"/> then to have the Sonne of God walking in our fleſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us thirty three yeares and an halfe? And what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter familiarity, then to make both Jew and Gentile, who were eſtranged from God, to bee one in himſelfe? Let us therefore boldly looke upon him in the revelation of his name: and learne in every thing in heaven or in earth, on the which we ſet our eyes, to reverence this great and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty name, the Lord our God.</p>
               <p>This being ſpoken concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſubject of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, the Attribute now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth in order to bee conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: and it is laid before us, in a word of ſanctification or hallowing: <hi>Hallowed bee thy name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For underſtanding hereof, wee will firſt looke what it is to hallow or ſanctifie: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in whoſe power it ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:20885:48"/> to ſanctifie: Thirdly, how Gods name is hallowed, or can be ſanctified of us.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to hallow or to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie any thing is, to vindicate the ſame from any abſurd or profane uſe to its owne holy and proper end: and therefore to hallow Gods name, is to vindicate it from all abuſe whatſoever, and to attribute to it the due honour and glory thereof. But let this be made a little more cleare.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God ſometimes halloweth: man ſometimes halloweth: and God, and man both do ſometimes hallow. God hallowed man by creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on making him to his image: God halloweth man by rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration in the day of his new birth: and God ſhall totally and finally hallow man in the day of his totall and finall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: ſo that whatſoever God halloweth it is poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:20885:49"/> hallowed: Man halloweth God, not by making him bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for what can a finite crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture adde to the felicity of the great and infinite Creator? Man therfore halloweth Gods name, but declaratively, when hee confeſſeth to the honour and glory of God, that hee hath nothing, but that which hee hath received: and when hee giveth praiſe unto him for the ſame. So that the hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſanctification of God to man, in reſpect of mans to him back againe, is as the cauſe to the effect, or as Gods ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, knowledge, &amp; love to us from eternity, cauſeth our ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, knowledge, &amp; love of God back againe in time.</p>
               <p>Finally, there be ſome things that God and man both hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth: and theſe are perſons, times places: <hi>i.</hi> his Miniſters, his Sabbaths, and his Churches: for theſe God hath hallowed,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:20885:49"/> and conſecrated to himſelfe. Man halloweth them by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and keeping them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without prophanation, and ſanctifying himſelfe in them, and by them.</p>
               <p>To ſpeake then in a word: Gods name is hallowed two wayes: notionally, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically.</p>
               <p>Notionally, when wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him aright, and in the thoughts of our heart do yeeld unto him that due reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which becommeth the creatures to give to the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator.</p>
               <p>Practically, when in the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our lives we do right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge the truth of his word, the riches of his mercy, the equity of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and the majeſtie of his workes.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</label> Now that wee may make uſe of this Petition, let us call to minde a little what
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:20885:50"/> hath beene ſaid: that under the name of God was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood his eſſence, his word, and his worke: his eſſence we cannot hallow, for wee can adde nothing to that which is infinite; neither can we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it ſufficiently; for here wee know but in a part, and ſee but in a part. Gods name is honoured in his word;</p>
               <p>Firſt, when it is reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when it is truſted.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when it is obeyed.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when it is reverenced, not as the word of man, but as the word of God: for this cauſe the Apoſtle <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul,</hi> at Corinth, preached not in the vaine inticing eloquence of humane wiſdome, leſt the croſſe of Chriſt ſhould be of no effect.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when it is truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for want of this truſt the old world was drowned, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:20885:50"/> 
                  <hi>Moſes</hi> debarred the land of Canaan: and mockers in the laſt time, ſhall receive a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that lingers not.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when it is obeyed: and men walke worthy of the calling wherunto they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. The wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of this made <hi>Eli</hi> his houſe deſolate, and <hi>Shilo</hi> a mockingſtocke. The want of this made the ſword to ſtay on the houſe of <hi>David:</hi> &amp; ſurely the want of this, ſhall one day beare witneſſe againſt the children of this generation.</p>
               <p>One thing reſteth, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God in his workes; and this ſort of ſanctification is threefold, according to the threefold eſtate of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for ſome of them wee contemplate onely, ſome of them wee acquire with toyle and much travell, and ſome of them wee uſe with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and true liberty. Wee contemplate the Sunne, the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:20885:51"/> Moone, and the ſtarres, all made for the glory of God, and the praiſe of his name: we poſſeſſe the earth, &amp; the ſeas with toyle, difficulty, and paine: wee uſe with liberty, and freedome, our meate, our drinke, and our apparell: In the firſt wee honour God, if from the excellencie of the creature, wee looke up to the admirable glory of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. In the ſecond we honour God, whilſt we care for them not with a thornie, but a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber care, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

And that Chriſt commandeth Sathan to be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent (ſpeaking out of a poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed man) for hee knew that his name would be diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whilſt it was named out of the mouth of the father of lyes: let our ſpeech there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bee powdered with ſalt.

                  <p>The ſite and poſture of this Petition is worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke: firſt, becauſe of the reference it hath with the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:20885:292"/> preceding petition: And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe of that refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence it hath with thoſe peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which ſucceed. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance it hath with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Petitions is: That in the laſt petition, wee craved that Gods name might be hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: that is to ſay, that the Majeſtie and holineſſe which is in himſelfe, and is Himſelfe, (for whatſoever is in God is God) that Juſtice, Mercy, and power that is in his workes: that truth, righteouſneſſe, and equity which is in his word, may not only be knowne and manifeſted to man, but alſo received, honored and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by man, in ſuch manner as is fit and due to ſo great a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, and ſo dread a name: So now in this Petition hee ſheweth us the way how to doe it: Namely, by ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our ſelves (as members of his Kingdome) to his ſupreme
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:20885:293"/> Soveraignty, for then chiefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ever till then is the name of God duely honored by man, when man by his due and lawfull obedience te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth himſelfe to bee a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in his Kingdome, and a member of his incorporation.</p>
                  <p>Againe, as this is the refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence it hath with the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Petition: So hath it alſo a neceſſary dependance with that which immediately ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth: For in the words next following, we crave that Gods will may be done: But it is certaine no man can doe Gods will, but hee who is a member of his Kingdome: Nor can any man keepe the law of God but by his grace. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.24. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 119.32.

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:20885:52"/> our perſons be firſt acceptable unto him in Chriſt Jeſus. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. here then is the true reaſon of this poſition, he that would either hallow or honor the name of God, or deſire to performe his will, muſt have a care, firſt to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, and made a member of his Kingdome; for the name of God can never bee truly honored, nor his will truly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, by any, but thoſe who are true members of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
                  <p>But it may bee enquired, cannot a wicked man doe the will of God?</p>
                  <p>I anſwere, that a wicked man may doe the thing that is good, as <hi>Ioab</hi> may give good counſell, <hi>Iudas</hi> may remember the poore, A Hypoerite like <hi>Achab</hi> may be humbled, A vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious man may cite and ſpeake Scripture, but all is abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for two cauſes.</p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:20885:53"/>
                  <p>Firſt, their perſons are not acceptable, they have no por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>David,</hi> nor inheritance in <hi>Ieſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, whatſoever they doe, they doe it not in that ſincerity, nor right intention towards the honor of God as doth become, but what they doe is in hypocriſie to be ſeen of men, and to procure honor and glory to themſelves, and for this cauſe God caſteth backe the duſt of their ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in their faces, and manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth their wickedneſſe both to men and Angells; Then O man if thou doſt deſire that the name of God may be hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and honored by thee: Or deſireſt that his will bee done in thee, or by thee: La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour then I pray thee that thou maiſt be made a member of his Kingdome, for as many as are called by the Spirit of God, are the ſons of God, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:20885:53"/> if the Spirit of him that raiſed JESVS from the dead doth dwell in our mortall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, our mortall bodies ſhall then alſo be raiſed by it: But if this incorporation ſhall bee wanting: though we ſhould give our bodies to be burnt in the fire, yet ſhall it not availe us. For as we live ſtrangers from the life of God, ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ſhall wee likewiſe die; and riſing ſtrangers to his Grace, we ſhall be thruſt out as ſtrangers from his Glory, to the ſuffering of that worme that dyeth not, and of that fire that never is extinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>Now let us come to the words, and conſider what is contained in them.</p>
                  <p>I finde in them three things; a Subject, an Attribute, and a Copulation.</p>
                  <p>The Subject is a Kingdome; the Attribute is a comming; and the word of Copulation, <hi>Thy.</hi>

                  <p>For underſtanding of this we muſt know that there is a threefold Kingdome: Of man, of Sathan, and of God.</p>
                  <p>The Kingdome of man is that preheminency and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty which God in his wiſedome hath eſtabliſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, giving to ſome authority to command, and to others a commandement to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey: and that for ſhunning of confuſion and diſorder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ſonnes of men, and the children of nature. And to teſtifie that God is the God of Order, and not of confuſion, he hath in his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſet a diſtinction amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt his creatures by way of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, three manner of waies.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He hath given a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and ſoveraignty to the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:20885:54"/> celeſtiall bodies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He hath given and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed a Kingdome and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty in man.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hee hath given a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and ſoveraignty to man.</p>
                  <p>The ſoveraignty and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome given to the celeſtiall bodies, is two-fold: Of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, and of dominion. The ſoveraignty of influence, is acknowledged in nature, and by all the children of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For not only doe theſe celeſtiall bodies expreſſe their influence on the earth, the ſea, and the fruits thereof: But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo on man, and the naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of man. For man having his body compoſed of the temperature of the foure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; Fire, Ayre, Earth, and Water, it doth ſenſibly feele the influence of theſe celeſtiall bodies in the mutation and alteration of his health and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:20885:55"/> conſtitution. And as God hath given a ſoveraignty of influence, ſo hath he likewiſe given a ſoveraignty of domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. For it is written, <hi>Gen:</hi> 1.16. <hi>Hee made two Great lights:</hi> the Sunne the greater light to rule the day, and the Moone the leſſer light to rule the night.</p>
                  <p>As he gave a Kingdome and ſoveraignty to the celeſtiall bodies: So did he alſo eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a ſoveraignty and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome on man; For hee gave unto him ſoveraignty and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the fiſhes of the Sea, the fowles of the Ayre, and over every living thing that moveth on the earth. Neither did hee alone ſubju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the unreaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures unto him: But what is more, hee did (by his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) eſtabliſh a ſoveraignty to man, amongſt men and the ſonnes of men. For amongſt
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:20885:55"/> them he hath in his wiſdome appointed ſome to be Maſters, ſome to be ſervants, ſome to be Parents, ſome to bee chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſome to bee husbands, ſome to bee wives, ſome to bee Judges, ſome to be peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſome to bee Miniſters, ſome to be hearers, ſome to bee Princes, and ſome to bee ſubjects. And in all of theſe, what hath hee done but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in man the Characters and veſtiges of his owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy and authority: For as he is God ouer all, and in all bleſſed for ever: So hee hath given unto man as the chiefe and ſoveraigne of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, a chiefe and ſoveraigne authority, not only over his fellow creatures, but alſo over his fellow Brethren, that in man, as the little world, man might perceive the ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God the creator and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne of the whole
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:20885:56"/> world. Laſt of all he hath ſet and eſtabliſhed a Kingdome and ſoveraignty in man, and that was the Kingdome and ſoveraignty of the image of God in man. For as ſome ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall bodies have a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome over the inferiour bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; As man hath authority over the creatures and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Brethren; So God hath a Kingdome in man, wherein the ſoule of man is that throne whereon he doth ſit. The conſcience is Gods immediate deputy, his aſſeſſors are the light of knowledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding writing out a law, his Sheriffe or Juſtice of peace is the will, The common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom he ruleth, are the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Now in all of theſe being compoſed and drawne up to an univerſall bulke and incorporation, the image of God ſtood in man. For as man was created the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:20885:56"/> King of the world, So God did let him ſee that hee was his immediate King and Superiour: And leaſt that at any time hee ſhould waxe proud and evaniſh, he eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed a ſpirituall Kingdome in man. Both that he might bee ſubdued to him that made him, and that he might learn to rule aright the Kingdome concreded unto him. This then is the Kingdome of man, a Kingdome over his fellow creatures, a Kingdome over his fellow Brethren, a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome over his innated affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>Sathan alſo hath a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: now will you enquire what that Kingdome is?</p>
                  <p>It muſt be anſwered, it is no true Kingdome, it is but a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannick uſurpation, like that of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot who made Iſraell</hi> to ſinne, or like that of the Bramble, who
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:20885:57"/> became King of the trees of the forreſt. That it is no true Kingdome, it is cleere out of theſe ſeverall inſtances: And the inſtances of his uſurpation are foure.
<list>
                        <item>1. His inauguration.</item>
                        <item>2. His Vaſſalls.</item>
                        <item>3. His government.</item>
                        <item>4. His remuneration or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>His <hi>inauguration</hi> in the firſt place doth cleere this: For he is neither borne to bee a King, nor choſen to bee King. Not borne a King, for hee is but a creature, and there is no true King but the Creator, who is the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. And as he is not a King by birth, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he is not a King by election, for none have choſen him to be King over them: Yea all that he poſſeſſeth he doth poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe by Tyranny. Hee ſaid to Chriſt in the day of his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:20885:57"/> 
                     <hi>All theſe are mine.</hi> But he lied (for the earth is the Lords and the fulneſſe thereof) in it, Sathan hath not one foot breadth but what hee either robs or uſurpes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His Vaſſalls ſhew alſo his illegitimation, for as it is in the Kingdome of God, ſo is it alſo in the true and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Kingdomes of men. In Gods Kingdome, as he giveth a law, ſo they obey, and ſay, <hi>Thy Will be done in earth as it is in heaven.</hi> He is the ſhepheard they are the flock: His ſheep heare his voice and they will not follow a ſtranger. In the Kingdome of Sathan it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, they are all children of diſobedience, howſoever conſpiring an evill, yet unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good worke they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate: Of whom the true Chriſtian may ſay as <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaid of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi, They are brethren in evill,</hi> but in their
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:20885:58"/> ſecret let not my ſoule come, and my glory be not thou joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with their <hi>Aſſembly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. In his <hi>government,</hi> how ruleth he I pray you? Not as a true ſoveraigne, but as a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous uſurpator. Hee hath no part in man, but that which he hath ſtolne. For he ſteales, Firſt light out of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; then true deſire out of the affections: and thereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, full authority and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement out of the will. Where I pray you had hee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver place ſince his fall but what he ſtole? He ſtole away by a lie the heart of <hi>Eve</hi> from God, the heart of <hi>Cain</hi> from his brother, the heart of <hi>Cham</hi> from his father, the heart of <hi>Eſau</hi> from his bleſſing, the heart of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> from his God, and the heart of <hi>Iudas</hi> from the Saviour of the world. Yea now he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, and he is likewiſe
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:20885:58"/> ſtealing, either our hearts from the word by ſleepe, or the ſeed of the word out of our hearts, that it may not take root and bring forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe to our peace.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. His uſurpation is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in his remuneration and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. A true King rewards anſwerably the ſervice of a good ſubject: and when hee findes his coffers emptie, hee will coyne occaſions to gratifie his faithfull ſervant. God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes this to himſelfe, as a part of his diſtributive juſtice. Who ever amongſt you kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled a fire upon my Altar in vaine? And againe, Try me if I ſhall not bleſſe thee. No, in this he hath made all fleſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable: For he maketh his ſunne to ſhine upon the good and upon the bad: and his raine to fall upon the wicked as upon the righteous. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this alone the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:20885:59"/> of God, to be liberall in his diſpenſation, for hee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther denyeth nor upbraideth. But amongſt the ſonnes of men alſo, it hath even in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture beene accounted foule and baſe to bee ingrate. <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi> could ſay to <hi>Permenio,</hi> it is not enough for <hi>Alexander</hi> to give; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> could ſay to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> Only in the Throne ſhall I be before thee: and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> (though in an evill courſe) can ſay, Aske of mee to the halfe of my Kingdome I will not deny it: Onely this baſe ſlave Sathan, who hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what hee hath uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and ſtolen: can both tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly entice the ſinne, and thereafter cruelly torment for ſinne: greedy by his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to make a proſelite: and by his torture and ingratitude to make a reprobate.</p>
                  <p>The Kingdome of man, and the kingdome of Sathan
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:20885:59"/> being thus pointed out: it reſts only, that wee looke on the Kingdome of God, of the which it is ſaid</p>

                  <p>Of this wee muſt enquire what it is, and then how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyfold it is.

                  <p>This Kingdome is different from the former two: For as concerning the Kingdomes of men, they were ſubordinate and under anothers authority: This is ſuprem and <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  <p>This being knowne, for the nature of this Kingdome: wee will now enquire a little of the ſeverall kindes thereof. Know then that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God is three-fold.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He hath a Kingdome of power.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Kingdome of grace.</p>

                  <p>By the firſt hee ruleth all his creatures: All the ſonnes of men; and all the divells in hell alſo. He ruleth the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, for his voice maketh the foundations of the earth to ſhake: The Cedars of Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non to tremble, and the goats of a thouſand mountaines to calve: He ruleth the ſonnes of men, either doing in them his will, by his Spirit of grace, or doing upon them his will,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:20885:60"/> by the ſtroake of his juſtice. He ruleth the divells in hell alſo: For howſoever they goe about like roaring Lions ſeeking to devoure us: Yet hath he kept a bridle in their lips, and a hooke in their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrells, ſo that they cannot doe what they would; for as their Maſter himſelfe confeſſeth concerning <hi>Iob:</hi> Whom can harme the man whom the Lord hedgeth about.</p>

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we muſt underſtand that this internall Kingdome of God, whereby he ruleth in the hearts of men, hath an oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite Kingdome, rebelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, to wit, the Kingdome of Sathan, for the overthrow whereof, and the maintenance
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:20885:61"/> of his owne, God hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in this his militant Church and Kingdome, theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A King, and ſome ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate ſubjects.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Oathes of allegiance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Lawes for obedience.</p>

                  <p>The King is God himſelfe: A Trinity in unity, and unity in Trinity: The Father, the Son, and Holy Ghoſt: God one in Eſſence, but diſtinguiſhed in Perſons.</p>
                  <p>The Subjects of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome are all the Saints of God, from the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> to the laſt man that ſhall ſtand upon the earth: The Fathers before the flood, the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes after the flood: The Prophets under the law: The Apoſtles under the Goſpell:
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:20885:61"/> The Martyrs their ſucceſſors: and we who are now in the end of time, become their fellow Brethren, as the poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Iacob</hi> dwelling in the tents of <hi>Shem.</hi> And finally, all that ſhall beleeve the Goſpell of Jeſus; for now there is no more Jew nor Gentile, nor Grecian, nor Barbarian, nor bond, nor free, but all are in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>Our Oath of allegiance we have given in our baptiſme and communion with him at his table.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt, a vowing to bee his people as hee is our God:</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond, promiſing to grow up in him, and in the grace given us, untill hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate his grace with his Glory.</p>
                  <p>The law of this Kingdome is that which is written part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the tenor of the law, and partly in the tenor of the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:20885:62"/> Goſpell. Neither ſo ſharpe as alwaies to have their cenſure written in the blood of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor, like <hi>Draces</hi> lawes: nor yet ſo remiſſe, that partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity might make of them a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders webbe: like thoſe of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;</hi> but ſo contemperate, that what juſtice required was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied: and what mercy cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved was freely yeelded.</p>
                  <p>The reward of tranſgreſſors and of well-doers is not defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive here alſo: For as every man ſoweth ſo ſhall he reape: He that ſoweth to the fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reape corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But he that ſoweth to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reape life and peace.</p>
                  <p>Now all of theſe doe ſhew her to be a Church, and a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Kingdome: Yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all let us remember I pray you: that it is but a militant Church, and a militant King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that wee have here.

                  <q>
                     <hi>Thy kingdome come.</hi>

               </epigraph>
               <p>IN this petition three things are chiefly to be remarked; the matter of the Petition, the manner of it, and the particle of copulation which ties the matter to the manner: the matter is a kingdome: the manner is our deſire, wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it to come; the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of copulation is, <hi>Thy,</hi> for it is no other kingdome wee deſire, but Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>Firſt then of the manner of our deſire, <hi>Come,</hi> and then of the title of appropriation, <hi>Thine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If wee ſhall returne to the manner of our deſire: wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that Gods kingdome may come: wherein for our better underſtanding, theſe foure ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:20885:64"/> things are remarkeable. Firſt, from whence it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to whom it comes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by what way, or in what manner it commeth.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to what end it commeth.</p>
               <p>Shall wee enquire from whence it commeth? I anſwer, from heaven: to whom it commeth? I anſwer, to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: how it commeth? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, it commeth not by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, but by diſpenſation: and finally, ſhall wee enquire to what end it commeth? I anſwer, it commeth for the manifeſtation of Gods glory, and the ſalvation of the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſinner: of each of theſe a word.</p>
               <p>Firſt, let us looke from whence it commeth; I have ſaid it commeth from heaven: for the kingdome of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either externall, or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:20885:65"/> or eternall, all of them come from heaven. His exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall kingdome commeth from heaven: for hee was king be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were made: for looke whatſoever they are in themſelves, that they are of him and by him. See <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezer</hi> in his better refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; It commeth not from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, but from God, who is the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of every good gift: it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth neither from Athens, nor Jeruſalem, for then either Philoſophers had beene Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs, or the Scribes, and Phariſees had beene domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors over the world: but not the firſt: for when they ſeeme to be wiſe they proved fooles, and God turned the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the prudent man to nought. No nor the ſecond: for although they ſate in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes chaire, yet they locked up the key of knowledge: and
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:20885:65"/> neither entred themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdome of God, nor did ſuffer other men to enter.</p>
               <p>If this Kingdome then bee neither from the Eaſt, nor from the Weſt, neither from Athens, nor from Jeruſalem: what reſts, but it muſt bee from heaven?</p>
               <p>If his externall kingdome be of this pitch, much more is his internall kingdome: the communication of his grace to man, and the ſoule of man, for the heart of manly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not within the compaſſe or power of man: hee onely that made the heart knoweth it, and hath the keyes thereof: when hee openeth no man ſhutteth: and when hee ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth there is no man can open againe: For <hi>Paul</hi> may plant, and <hi>Apollo</hi> may water, but only God giveth the increaſe: and without him our word is but a tinkling braſſe.</p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:20885:66"/>
               <p>It reſts then that wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his eternall kingdome which is onely from him, by him, and for him: for from thence hee hath thruſt ſome, before time: ſuch are the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Angells: ſome in the tract and progreſſe of time: ſuch are the diſobedient, and incredulous: &amp; ſome in the end of time: ſuch are they whom he knoweth not. What reſteth then, but, ſince all things are of him, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, through him, and for him, that unto him we ſhould aſcribe the onely bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our ſalvation: neither ſaying with the <hi>Pelagian,</hi> nor with the <hi>Somi-Pelagian,</hi> that our ſalvation is either in all, or in part, of our ſelves; for of our ſelves wee are not able to thinke a good thought, but whatſoever wee have, wee have received, and if it be ſo, why ſhould wee glory? &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, I enquire to whom it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:20885:66"/> I anſwer, to the elect &amp; to the elect onely; for many are called but few are choſen. And to ſpeake plainly to you, In all the diſpenſation of God, nothing is more fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remarkable then this: to whom the kingdome of God co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth. For as it was before time: ſo it is in the fulneſſe of time, &amp; as it is in the courſe &amp; fulnes of time, ſo it ſhall be in the end of time; Before time all were not choſen; but hee loved <hi>Iacob,</hi> and hated <hi>Eſau:</hi> hee appointed ſome to be veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of honour, and ſome of diſhonour; hee had mercy on whom he would have mercy, and whom hee would hee left to the hardneſſe of their own heart: In time, hee calleth who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he will, the reſt are rejected.</p>
               <p>When the old world was drowned, hee ſaved <hi>Noah.</hi> When <hi>Sodome,</hi> and <hi>Gomorah</hi> was burnt, he ſaved <hi>Lot:</hi> when
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:20885:67"/> all the world were Idolaters hee called his ſervant <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> and when all the Jewes were oppoſites to his Sonne, hee called the poore to bee parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Goſpell. No, I muſt tell you a myſtery; As the choice of the heires of Gods kingdome from eternity, was not of all, but of ſome: ſo is not the diſpenſation of the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in time, of all, but of ſome few, for it will come in a land, but not in every city: it will enter in a city, but not in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry family: and it will enter in a family, but not lay hand on every perſon of the family.</p>
               <p>I ſay firſt, it will come to a land, but not to every city: for it came to Judah, for there his name was knowne: but not to every city, for it did not come to the <hi>Gargaſens,</hi> they prefer their ſwine before Chriſt. It will come to a city
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:20885:67"/> for it came to Jericho, &amp; called none but <hi>Zacheus;</hi> it came to Philippi, it chuſed none but <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> &amp; the <hi>Gaoler.</hi> It will come to a family, but not to every perſon of the family: to Rome, but not to <hi>Nere:</hi> to the family of <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> but not to his owne heart. And as before time, the kingdome of God was not ordeined for all, but for ſome few: and as in time, it is not effectuall to all, but to ſome few: ſo after all time, it ſhall not bee given to all, but to ſome few: for according to the efficacie of the diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof in time; ſuch ſhall bee the donation and fruition thereof after all time, and in the end of time; for two ſhall bee at the mill grinding; the one ſhall bee received, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall be refuſed: two ſhall be lying in one bed, the one ſhall bee received, the other refuſed: two ſhall be walking
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:20885:68"/> by the way, the one ſhall bee received, the other refuſed, although they aske they ſhall not receive: although they ſeeke, they ſhall not finde: although they knocke it ſhall not be opened; for this ſhall bee their anſwer, depart from mee yee workers of iniquity, verily I know yee not.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</label> Well then, is the proviſion of the kingdome of God, appointed but for ſome few? is the diſpenſation thereof, effectuall but in few? is the donation, and fruition thereof beſtowed but upon few? why ſhould wee not then ſerve the Lord in feare, and rejoyce before him in trembling: redeeming the time; becauſe the dayes are evill?</p>
               <p>If the Lord ſhould deale with us, as he did in the daies of <hi>Gedeon,</hi> poure out raine on the world, and let our fleece
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:20885:68"/> be dry: If he ſhould deale with us as hee dealt with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> make light to ſhine in Goſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and leave our Egypt to a palpable darkneſſe: or as hee dealt with <hi>Achab,</hi> make raine to fall upon all the territories about, when Iſarell was burnt up with heat: would we not take it as a token of his anger againſt us? O foole and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, thou canſt deſcerne the face of the skie, and the eſtate of the weather, but the eſtate of thine owne ſoule thou canſt not deſcerne: thou canſt mourn if thy field bee not as fruitfull as thy neighbours: if thy ſhip returne not as proſperous as thy neighbours: if thy ſhop have not as many cuſtomers as thy neighbours: thou canſt droope all the day long, and hang downe thy head, as they that mourne with out hope: and as <hi>Rachael</hi> weeping for her children, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:20885:69"/> refuſing comfort. But alas, there is a ſoule within thee, and it is more graceleſſe then thy neighbours: thou haſt an eye, and it is blinder then thy neighbours: an eare, and it is deafer then thy neighbours: an heart, and it is harder then thy neighbours; and yet thou canſt not mourne for this: What ſhall I ſay to thee? to cut thee altogether off from hope of mercy, I will not; but this I will ſay, unleſſe thou redeem the time, and ſorrow in time, thou ſhalt ſorrow deſperately, becauſe thou didſt not ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſooner: and (like Iſrael led captive) becauſe thou didſt not mourne in Jeruſalem, thou ſhalt mourne in Babel, and ſhalt not be comforted.</p>
               <p>The third queſtion, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the comming of Gods Kingdome is, how, and in what manner it commeth.</p>
               <p>And ſurely amongſt all the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:20885:69"/> reſt, this is the chiefeſt queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of greateſt difficulty. Yet that I may ſpeake to your capacities, I will tell you, Gods Kingdome commeth to you, when his grace commeth to you.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, how ſhall I deſcerne, or know the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of his grace to mee?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God commeth not by humane obſervation, ſo as any man can poſitively ſay: Lo here is Chriſt, or loe there he is not: Yet whenſoever it commeth, and whereſoever it commeth, it is obſervable, and that by theſe three things that are different. 1 The time. 2 The manner. 3. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>The time of the comming of Gods kingdom is not alike to all, but different: for it came to ſome men before the Law: as to <hi>Adam, Enock, Noah, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:20885:70"/> Iſaack,</hi> and <hi>Iacob.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It came to ſome men under the Law; as to <hi>Moſes, Ioſhua, Caleb, David, Samuel,</hi> and the Prophets.</p>
               <p>It came to ſome men in the infancie of the Goſpell: as to <hi>Matthew, Andrew, Peter, Iames, Iohn, Nichodemus,</hi> and the woman that came to the well of Samaria.</p>
               <p>It comes to ſome men now in the ſtrength of the Goſpell; for many are called, and few are choſen: And if our goſpell bee hid, it is hid to them that periſh. Neither is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall period of theſe times one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remarkable: But will you looke to the winde when it blowes?</p>
               <p>Sometimes before the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: as on <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> before they were born.</p>
               <p>Sometimes in the dawning of the day: as on <hi>Samuel</hi> and the Evangeliſt <hi>Timothie.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:20885:70"/>
               <p>Sometimes at the noontide of the day; as on <hi>Eliſha</hi> the Prophet, and <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>And ſometimes at the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſetting of our Sun; as upon the theefe on the Croſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſhall wee looke on the manner of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: It is alſo wonderfull, For ſometimes hee commeth, and eſtabliſheth his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in us by meanes, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times without meanes. By meanes (although weake) to <hi>Eliſha</hi> by <hi>Eliahs</hi> mantle: to <hi>Peter</hi> by a looke of Chriſts eye: to the Apoſtles by prayer: and to <hi>Mary</hi> by a ſalutation; Without meanes: when by his inward operation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all that wee do either thinke or expect, hee (as one having the keyes of the houſe of <hi>David</hi>) doth open, and none can ſhut.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in reſpect of the meaſure; for to ſome hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:20885:71"/> a weake faith, as the graine of a muſtardſeed: to another he giveth ſo ſtrong a faith that the gates of hell cannot prevaile againſt it. To one hee giveth grace to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; to another grace to confeſſe, to a third grace to ſuffer for his name ſake; And all theſe things workes the ſelfe ſame ſpirit, diſtributing to every man ſeverally as hee willeth. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11.</p>
               <p>Now this diverſity of the manner of the comming of Gods Kingdome, ſhould teach us a ſpirituall induſtry. You know the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe, take tide in time, for tide and time will ſtay for no man: looke the mariner, who hath a ſhippe going to ſea: as he is earneſt to lanch out to the deepe, yet cannot when hee would, but muſt ſtay till the tide make, and when it is made, it wil not wait an houre
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:20885:71"/> upon his leaſure, for if hee take it not in time, it will ebbe, and he ſhall not get out: Even ſo in our ſpirituall navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to the Kingdome of God when grace offers it ſelf, it hath a certain time, a certain meaſure, &amp; a certain meane: the w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> if we imbrace, we make a good voyage: if wedeſpiſe, we loſe our journey. Then would you be a good merchant, when you ſee the winde of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit blow, and the tide of grace make; for Gods ſake delay not, hoyſe your ſailes, make ſtraight your tackle, get you to reading, prayer, meditation, and ſpirituall conference. It is hard to know (if thou bloweſt in time upon that poore coale which God by his grace hath kindled in thee) what a fire it ſhall bring forth to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his name, and the peace of thy owne conſcience. But if thou blow not in time, Oh
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:20885:72"/> how dead a coale ſhall thy heart prove, to blow at out of time: thou mayſt blow whilſt the bellows rent, but life thou ſhalt not get in it: for by thy negligence thou haſt loſt the tyde, and quenched the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpirit, which offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſelfe to thee for thy ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the laſt thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in the comming of Gods Kingdome; is, to what end it commeth. I anſwer, it commeth to worke in thee a ſeavenfold worke.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a worke of illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that in his light thou mayeſt ſee thine owne dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a worke of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, ſaying, as to <hi>Adam, Adam where art thou, haſt thou eaten of the tree whereof I did forbid thee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, a worke of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, <hi>Curſed bee thou, for
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:20885:72"/> thou haſt not continued to obey the things written in the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, a worke of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, making thee to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thy couch with teares: and to goe out &amp; weepe bitterly.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, a worke of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>Goe thy way home, thy ſins are forgiven thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, a worke of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: whilſt by his ſpirit hee cryes in thee, <hi>Abba,</hi> father.</p>
               <p>Seaventhly, and laſtly, a worke of confirmation, and perſeverance; whilſt hee keepes thee by the power of his ſpirit through faith to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſalvation. What do we here pray for? this: that Gods Kingdome may come; and why ſo? becauſe wee can never goe to it, except it do firſt come to us, for ſuch as is his eternall knowledge, his eternall love &amp; his eternall ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; ſuch is the diſpenſation of thoſe his graces in time:
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:20885:73"/> and their remuneration in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry after all time: what is then thy duty, Oh man? herken and I will tell thee: Since God hath made his Kingdome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for thee, make thou thy ſelfe ready for it. I ſay, hee hath made his kingdome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, <hi>Omnia enim ſunt parata.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All things are ready: Matt.</hi> 22. <hi>Paratae ſunt nuptiae,</hi> the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is ready. <hi>Parata eſt coena,</hi> his ſupper is ready. <hi>Paratum eſt cubiculum,</hi> his marriage chamber is ready. <hi>Paratum eſt cubile,</hi> his bed is ready: <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt &amp; regnum,</hi> and his Kingdome is ready. Now are all things on his part ready, and thou art not ready: Then woe bee unto thee that ever thou waſt borne: for Gods ſake then dreſſe and trimme thy ſelfe in time, and ſay, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum eſt cormeum, My heart is ready. Pſalm.</hi> 57.7. and learn with the ſpirit in the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:20885:73"/> to ſay, <hi>The day of the Lambes marriage is come, and his bride hath made herſelfe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> Bleſſed is the man who in that expectation can ſo ſay: ſurely hee ſhall not want his reward; and it ſhall be ſaid to him: <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, poſſeſſe the Kingdome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for yon.</hi> And when you are come in, it ſhall be cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſaid to you; eate and drinke my friends, make mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry my well beloved.</p>
               <p>And now having ſpoken concerning the matter, and manner of the Petition; it reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that wee ſpeake concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the copulation of the one with the other: <hi>Thy,</hi> This word is very well inſerted here: for as none can truly ſay, <hi>Our Father,</hi> but hee who is borne of God, and is a fellow member of Chriſts body: ſo none can deſire Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to come, but hee who

                  <p>AS in the former Petitions ſo in this alſo wee will firſt looke to the reaſon why it is ſo placed, and next, to the matter of the Petition. The placing of it is remarkable: both in reſpect of the Preface, as alſo of the preceding Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. When wee looke to the Preface, this followeth excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding well upon it. For there is propounded to us that <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum bonum</hi> and chiefe good, which the Sonnes of men doe aime at (God himſelfe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by faith, communicated by love, and expected by hope of conſummation:) to the which wee can never attaine, but by doing his will: For the Kingdome and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:20885:76"/> of God is not given to rebells nor diſobedients: but to Sonnes and obeyers. For none ſhall enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, but they that know the will of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and doe it. And as it hath this reference with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face <hi>viz</hi> a reference of inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: So when you looke upon it in the reference it ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth with the preceding Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: you ſhall finde the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and relation demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative. For as God, in all things, and above all things, he hath care of his owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and the glory of his name. For it is written, <hi>My Glory I will not give to another.</hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</label> Now from this, that God demonſtratively tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us how wee ſhall know whether wee bee members of his kingdome or not: I finde that there is a leſſon requiſite
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:20885:77"/> to every Chriſtian to be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſalvation, to wit, That hee ſhould try and examine himſelfe, in what meaſure of grace he ſtandeth. For many times our hearts flatter us: and we cry peace to our ſelves, when God meanes us no peace.</p>
                  <p>Yea many times wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne our ſelves in the ſenſe of our ſinnes, when God condemneth us not, nor mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any thing but our excita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from ſecurity. Leaſt therefore that we ſhould mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, looking upon a flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſecurity as a true peace: And leaſt in the day of our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, wee ſhould miſtake the arrowes of <hi>Ionathans</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement, for the arrowes of <hi>Sauls</hi> malice and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: God hath given us here a touchſtone, to know both the nature of our peace, as alſo of our correction, which is this,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:20885:77"/> Looke to Gods will, and what thou haſt done concerning it. Whilſt thy ſoule ſpeaks peace to thee, and ſayes with the Publican, I thanke God I am not a ſinner as this man: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent not thy ſelfe with that naked and generall verdict, for it may deceive thee as it did him: For he went away unjuſtified. But draw rather home to the conſcience of thy obedience: and ſee how thy will hath beene ſubdued to Gods will, and thy affections captivated to his obedience: and from thence draw home (in a practicall Syllogiſme) the true aſſurance of thy joy.</p>
                  <p>For as by faith in Jeſus Chriſt wee have peace with God, ſo on the other part, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more ſure then that faith worketh by love, &amp; that faith without workes is but a dead faith: and he that brags
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:20885:78"/> of it, may well have a name that he is living, but in effect he is dead.</p>
                  <p>Againe, on the other part, it is as requiſite (for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the day of our troubled conſcience by ſinne) that wee looke to the care of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Gods will: for as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> telleth us: <hi>Of my ſelfe I know no evill, yet by this I am not juſtified.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Of my ſelfe I know no good yet by this I am not condemned.</hi> So it is with every Chriſtian, as he hath not ſo much good in him, as by vertue of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit may make him looke to get heaven: So hath hee not ſo much evill in him, as can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtrate him from heaven, if he have but a will and deſire to doe Gods will:</p>
                  <p>For the beſt of Gods Saints may bee juſtified, but are not in this life ſanctified wholly. There
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:20885:78"/> is in them two men, the old and the new: the fleſh and the Spirit: and theſe are ſo contrary one to the other that wee cannot doe the things which we would. Yet in the middeſt of this our defect, if wee have a delight in Gods law concerning the inner man: all is well, for by this we may know, that hee hath begunne, and will accompliſh his work in us. Yea what is more, ſince the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> fell, never man was able to doe Gods will, Jeſus Chriſt being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</p>
                  <p>Not <hi>Abraham, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Salomon,</hi> nor <hi>Sampſon,</hi> On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Jeſus Chriſt the ſecond <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> hath fully done it, and in his perfect obedience hath co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered our defects, and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.

                  </p>
                  <p>To come now to the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelfe, the parts thereof are two.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is ſimple, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is comparative or ſet downe with a refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
                  <p>The ſimple and poſitive part is, <hi>Thy will be done.</hi>

                  <p>Of the object of our Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Gods will. Wee muſt know that by the learned, the will of God is diverſly taken and conſidered.

                  <p n="1">1. For that faculty of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and willing which is in God: And this they call <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  <p n="3">3. For the thing which he willeth: And this they call <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>As for the firſt ſignification, whilſt it is taken for the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of willing: In that ſenſe it is one with the eſſence of God.</p>
                  <p>For as God in himſelfe and by himſelfe underſtands, and knoweth, and is wiſe, ſo alſo he willeth. For whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in God is God: and that neither by way of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:20885:80"/> or compoſition, but by way of eſſence and eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſecond, for the act of his willing: Wee muſt underſtand, that God willeth not as man willeth: For man being but a finite and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall creature, willeth but in time, and that in variety, alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and change: But God being infinite and unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, hath willed from eternity that which is done in time, or ſhall bee done after all time: and nothing is or ſhall bee done for ever, but that which in eternity, hee both willed and decreed. And in this ſenſe the will of God, is one with the eſſence of God alſo: For as he is eternall and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo is alſo his will.</p>
                  <p>As to the third and laſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, to wit, the thing which God willeth. For un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding hereof, know
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:20885:81"/> that the object of Gods wil is three-fold.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, hee willeth himſelfe and his owne glory.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he willeth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning the end of his creatures, theſe are called his decrees.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he willeth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning the way to that end; and that is either o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience or diſobedience.</p>
                  <p>Now it may bee enquired, what is meant here by the will of God.</p>
                  <p>I anſwere, not the firſt, not the ſecond, but the third.</p>
                  <p>And that, in all the three ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptations thereof: both that which concerneth himſelfe and his glory, in that which concerneth the end of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and in that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth the way to that end.</p>
                  <p>But if theſe bee too deepe for thee I will ſpeake more plainly, and point out to the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:20885:81"/> will of God concerning us, for thy better underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>I muſt then tell you, in ſo farre as it concerneth man, it is of two ſorts: or rather conſidered by man in two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers manners.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, as it is hidde and couched up in Gods owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to us, either by his <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vâ voce,</hi> or by his written word.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt ſenſe it is called Gods ſecret will: In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond it is called his manifeſt and revealed will.</p>
                  <p>Of the firſt, to wit, Gods hidden and ſecret will, it is that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>O deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable are his judgements, and his wayes paſt finding out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the ſecond, it is ſaid, <hi>Not he who cryeth Lord Lord
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:20885:82"/> ſhall enter into the Kingdome of God: but hee who knoweth the will of my Father and doth it.</hi> And of both conjunctly it is ſaid by <hi>Moſes:</hi> that, ſecret things belong to the Lord: Things revealed to us and to our children, that we may do them. Firſt then of the firſt point.</p>
                  <p>It may bee enquired, if in this Petition we do or ſhould pray for his ſecret will. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare, No: for his ſecret will ſhall come to paſſe: For hee dwells in heaven, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſecret pleaſure and counſell of his will, all things in time and after time ſhall be moderated. Is it not lawfull then in any condition to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the hidden and ſecret counſell of God? Yea ſurely, providing it bee with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For firſt wee may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire why it is ſo called.</p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:20885:82"/>
                  <p n="2">2. What is our duty in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And how farre it can have any fellowſhip with the evill that is in the world, and with the ſinfull actions of men.</p>
                  <p>Why is it ſo called?</p>
                  <p>I anſwere, for two cauſes:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe it is hidden from man, who cannot reach to it untill God reveale it. <hi>For no man knoweth the Father but the Sonne, and hee to whom the Sonne revealeth him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe when it is revealed, man cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it, except hee be enabled from above. For the reaſons of Gods ſecret wayes exceeds humane capacity: And the more that humane reaſon loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth on it, the leſſe it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth. Why God loved <hi>Iacob</hi> and hated <hi>Eſau:</hi> Why he rejected <hi>Saul</hi> for one fault, and forgave <hi>David</hi> many:
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:20885:83"/> and why he condemned <hi>Iudas</hi> for ſelling of him, and ſpared <hi>Peter</hi> that did forſweare him, Enquire the reaſon hereof at man, hee cannot give it you; yea God hath revealed it: <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and whom I will I harden.</hi> And now as man could not give this reaſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till God revealed it: So now when God hath revealed it, man cannot comprehend it.</p>
                  <p>For nature would ſay, that it was injuſtice in God, of two men equally evill by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to chooſe the one and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the other. Thus Gods will is called ſecret, firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe man knoweth it not, and ſecondly, becauſe hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What is our duty in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of this will?</p>
                  <p>I anſwere, it is our duty not to ſearch into it too deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: <hi>Nam noneſt curioſe inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganda,

Since it is Gods ſecret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, it is not fit thou ſhouldeſt enquire it. Stoope under the abſtruſe and hidden ſecrecy thereof. But to enquire of it ere God reveale it, is but a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before the time: and ſure I am it ſhall never be laid to thy charge in the day of Judgement how farre thou haſt ſearched into the ſecret counſell of God: But how farre thou haſt obeyed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, concerning the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret will of God, it may bee enquired: ſince there is ſo much evill in the world: how farre and in what ſort, God by his ſecret will concurreth, and hath cooperation with the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:20885:84"/> ſame, for men looking on the evills that are in the world, and finding them ſo frequent and fearefull: and withall comparing them with the omnipotence of God, againſt whoſe will nothing can bee done: and not being able to ſolve this riddle: have either with the Libertine caſt over the cauſe of their iniquities upon God, and made God the Author of ſinne: Or elſe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſpeake blaſphemouſly of God, they have with the Manicheans invented two chiefe and prime cauſes of all things, one of good, another of evil, both equally ſupreme, and abſolute in their kinde, which is altogether falſe, for God is only the ſupreme and abſolute good, but Sathan is not an abſolute evill.</p>
                  <p>But for cleering of this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, a little underſtand and know, The evill is two-fold:
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:20885:84"/> An evill of ſinne, and an evill of puniſhment, and this is <hi>Tertullians</hi> diſtinction, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt <hi>Marcian, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 180. Concerning the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill which we call the evill of puniſhment, there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, for it is not a true evill in it ſelfe, it is but thought ſo of us, for the puniſhment of ſinne, though it ſeemes evill to the offender, yet it is no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill in it ſelfe, for it is a good of juſtice. The queſtion is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerning the evill of ſin: and how farre God communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates with it, not being the author thereof, nor tainted himſelfe therewith. This queſtion is ſo much the more remarkable, by how much Scripture ſeems to give way to it. For it was a ſinne in <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to harden his heart: Yet Scripture ſaith that God willed it, and that hee did it. It was a ſinne in Sathan to be a
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:20885:85"/> lying ſpirit in the mouthes of <hi>Achabs</hi> Prophets: Yet Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhewes us that God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it. It was a ſinne in Sathan to vexe <hi>Iob</hi> unjuſtly: and yet Scripture ſheweth that God willed it. And it is a ſinne in man to ſtoppe his eare againſt the truth, and to beleeve a lie, and yet Scripture ſheweth that God willeth it.</p>
                  <p>For ſolving of this doubt there is a very good anſwere given by our Divines to this queſtion: whileſt they ſay, that wee muſt diſtinguiſh the action of the ſinner, from the ſinne that is in the action: And they make God the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the action, but not of the vicioſity and evill that is in the action. And this they cleere by the examples of the Sunne, the Earth, and the word of God. This I grant is good, but not ſufficient. But wouldeſt thou know O man
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:20885:85"/> how God willeth ſinne, and over-ruleth ſinne, and yet is free from ſinne? Then thou muſt know that ſinne, and the way of ſinne, hath a beginning, a progreſſe, and alſo an end: God hath a will working on ſinne, and over-ruling ſinne, in all theſe three reſpects.</p>
                  <p>For ſhall we looke to ſinne in the beginning thereof: Gods will hath beene two wayes exerciſed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, by way of inhibition, in giving a law againſt it, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding ſinne in the thoughts of the heart, in the words of the mouth, and in the actions of the converſation.</p>
                  <p>By way of permiſſion, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a lawleſſe man to a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe way: For it is a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing with God (when man knowing him to be God, will not glorifie him as God) to leave that man to himſelfe to doe the things that are not convenient</p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:20885:86"/>
                  <p>Secondly, ſhall wee looke to the progreſſe of ſinne, God hath a reference with it alſo, and that either by impeaching and hindring it, or by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling it. By impeachment, he dryed up <hi>Ieraboams</hi> hand; and hedged Iſraels way with Thornes. Or by over-ruling it: as to <hi>Iob, All that he hath is in thy hand, only on himſelfe, ſee thou lay not thy hand.</hi> And the Jewes ſought to lay hands on Chriſt, but they could not, for his houre was not yet come.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſhall we looke on it in the end: God hath an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruling reference with it alſo: For he either puniſheth it or pardoneth it: with the want of grace in this life, or of glory in the life to come; or then pardoneth it, fully, freely, and finally: Fully, all our ſinnes: Freely, in reſpect of us: Finally; in this life, and that alſo which is to come.</p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:20885:86"/>
                  <p>And all this without ſinne, or the leaſt blemiſh of ſinne.</p>
                  <p>For in the beginning of ſinne he ſheweth his wiſedome:</p>
                  <p>In the progreſſe, hee ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his power:</p>
                  <p>In the end, he maketh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt both his Juſtice and his Mercy.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</label> In all of theſe let us learne to tremble, and ſtand in awe; and to take heed to our wayes.</p>
                  <p>For whilſt wee ſinne, though God hath ſome ſort of reference with our actions, yet it is ſuch as ſhall neither ſtaine him, nor excuſe us. For as in the betraying and death of Jeſus Chriſt, God had not onely ordained it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time, but alſo all the wayes leading to it: yet did not this ſave <hi>Iudas,</hi> or the Jewes from going to hell: For although the action was of God, and the moderation
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:20885:87"/> thereof, both in the beginning, progreſſe, and end thereof: yet the ſinne and vicioſity of the action was of Sathan and man; Therefore have they both their juſt reward: Hee by the ſeede of the woman hath his head trodden downe; They, becauſe of their ſinne, have gone to their place, where their worm dyeth not, and their fire goeth not out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. <hi>David</hi> was afraid at <hi>Perez Vzzah;</hi> Wee ſhould bee much more at <hi>Baal Peratſim.</hi> 1. <hi>Chronicles</hi> 14.</p>

               <p>HAving ſpoken in our laſt ſermon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Gods ſecret will: It reſteth now that we ſpeak concerning his revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will, which two, are not in theſelves two ſeverall, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, or contrary wills in God, but are two ſeverall, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manners of conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one and the ſelfe ſame thing in God: for as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghoſt, being one in eſſence, do not differ in their eſſence, but in their exiſtence: ſo doe not the hidden, and revealed will of God differ one from another really, but by diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of our conſideration: for that very ſame will of God, which being hidden from us, is called the ſecret will of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:20885:88"/> God: and being manifeſted to us, is called the revealed will of God.</p>
               <p>In handling hereof theſe things are conſiderable.</p>
               <p>Firſt, what is his revealed will, or where it is to be found.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what are the points of his will, which hee revealeth to us.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whether wee may joyne our will to Gods will; and ſay, My will bee done, as thy will be done.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing remarkable is; what Gods revealed will is: and I anſwer; It is all that which hee hath revealed to us, and deſireth to be obeyed of us, either in the Law, or in the Goſpell. And in a word: whilſt wee deſire of him that we may do his will; we begge of him, that ſince hee gave us firſt a law of nature, inabled ſufficiently to do what was required of us: Secondly, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:20885:88"/> he gave us a law of works, as a touchſtone, to make knowne to us the weakneſſe of our corrupt nature: Thirdly, &amp; ſeeing he hath given us the law of faith, or of the goſpell, repairing in us the loſſe of the law of nature: hee would bee pleaſed to pity our firſt defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: to repaire in us our ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond weakneſſe, and to accept of our weake endeavours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the goſpell, as perfect in him who was perfect in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And that hee would ſanctifie us by his grace, to the endeavour of that which as yet is imperfect: and accept at our hands of the will as the deed.</p>
               <p>In this Petition then, I ſee three things are ſet before our eyes. Our naturall integrity by creation: Our naturall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in our apoſtacie: and our dignity in our adoption. The firſt wee confeſſe; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:20885:89"/> wee do bewaile: the third wee hunger and thirſt for.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</label> Theſe two then, the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the law, and the word of faith received in the goſpell, do clearly teach us two things, firſt a refutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church of Rome, in the matter of mans merit: for they are bold to claime right to the Kingdome of heaven, not only by the works of abſolute ſatisfaction done to the law, but alſo by reliques of ſupererogation, left to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for their ſupport. But for refelling hereof, let mee enquire of thee, O man, who art thus bold, blaſphemouſly to barke againſt heaven: Why doſt thou annihilate the croſſe of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p>Thou canſt not goe out at the doore without a croſſe about thy necke: and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thou art the enemie of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:20885:89"/> the Croſſe of Jeſus: for it is written: If righteouſneſſe come by law, Jeſus Chriſt dyed in vaine. And againe, If life come by workes, then grace is no more grace; And if it bee of grace, then workes are no more workes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, why doſt thou ſpend thy prayers, and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations in vaine? I may ſay to thee, out of due conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what <hi>David</hi> ſpoke out of precipitation and raſhneſſe, when hee ſaw the wicked floriſh, and the evill man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper in all his wayes; hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thus with God (although amiſſe) Why have I purged my heart in vaine, and waſhed my hands in innocencie for nought? So would I ſay to thee; If thou haſt as much in thee, as may obey the deſire of the Law, what needeſt thou to pray to God for it: or
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:20885:90"/> in the morning to ſay, Let thy will bee done by mee, when thou haſt as much ſtrength in thy ſelfe by nature as to doe that and more.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, why annihilates thou the nature of a true me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? for to eſtabliſh a true me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, thou muſt give God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is thy owne, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that thou oweſt not and ſomething that is proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the reward thou fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt. I ſay, thou muſt give God ſomething that is thy owne: now ſure thou haſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that which is given thee: for of thy ſelfe thou canſt neither will or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme.</p>
               <p>Secondly, thou muſt give him ſomething that thou oweſt him not: But what is that I pray thee, that comes not under the compaſſe of his law, ſince in it there is a yoke laid on the thoughts of thy
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:20885:90"/> heart, the words of thy mouth, and all the actions of thy converſation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I ſay thou muſt doe ſomething to God, that muſt be proportionable to the reward that thou ſeekeſt. Now what proportion I pray you, can bee betwixt that which is finite, temporall and corrupt, and that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, eternall, and incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible. Woe bee unto that man, that ſhall be thus audaciouſly blaſphemous, as to ſay, hee hath merited any thing but condemnation: For that man appearing before God, and wanting his wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus) ſhall ſurely be ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped naked, and his nakedneſſe ſhall be ſeene of men, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
               <p>But thou wilt enquire, If man bee not able to obey the Law, how can God in his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:20885:91"/> give him a Law, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him for the breach there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? To the firſt I anſwer thee out of naturall reaſon, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou haſt rendered thy ſelfe unable to obey, what injuſtice is it with God to exact thy obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, for he cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated thee able to obey what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hee required of thee? Is it not ſo amongſt the ſonnes of men in civill actions? but what is more, God giveth thee although thou be unable, a law to ſquare thy life by, for three cauſes: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t ſcias quid ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceperis; ut videas quid amiſeris; ut intelligas unde repetendum ſit quod amiſeris;</hi> and as he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the obedience of his law of thee for theſe 3 cauſes, ſo doth he alſo correct the breach therof, for 3 cauſes. 1. <hi>Ad oſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> debitae miſeriae.</hi> 2 <hi>ad emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dationem labilis vitae.</hi> And 3. <hi>ad exercitatione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neceſſariae patientiae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</label> Since in the tenour of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:20885:91"/> the Law, and the Goſpell, the revealed will of God is ſhut up as in a treaſury, or ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe: Why is it that man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in ignorance? for from the knowledge of the will of God in theſe, there ariſeth light to the underſtanding, and ſanctification to the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. If it bee ſo, why then doth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit her followers the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Scriptures, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne to them an implicite faith? Is this any thing elſe, but to make the blinde lead the blinde, that both may fall? or is it any thing elſe, but to ſhut up the key of knowledge, and neither enter themſelves into the kingdome of God, nor ſuffer others to enter? And finally, is this any thing elſe, but to keep captive in chaines of darkneſſe the poore people, making them by the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men, to account the will
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:20885:92"/> of God of no effect. The Lord open their eyes, to ſee the vanity of the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they walke; and the Lord eſtabliſh our hearts in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of the light revealed to us; leſt this be our condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that light hath ſhined, but wee have continued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of the light, becauſe our workes were evill.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing offered to our conſideration, is, what are the points of his revealed will, and what are the duties which hee requireth to bee done of us. To this I anſwer, It were a tedious worke to runne over all the duties of a Chriſtian required of him in this word: yet for an inſtance, the word of God requireth of us. 1. The knowledge of Gods will. 2. Faith in his word. 3. Obedience to the word beleeved. 4. Suffering for the teſtimony thereof,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:20885:92"/> when wee ſhall be called to it 5. And finally, an hungring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our diſſolution, becauſe we cannot get theſe things done. I ſay firſt, God requireth of us to know him, for thus it is written, <hi>This is life everlaſting, to know thee to bee the onely true God.</hi> And againe, <hi>I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to know nothing, but Ieſus Chriſt, and him crucified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thou wilt ſay, how ſhall I know God?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, God is knowne by nature: for the naturall man, although hee know not the true God, yet by naturall knowledge hee propoundeth ſomething to himſelfe for a God. And this ſhall ſerve for a witneſſe againſt him: for whilſt by nature hee doth the things of the Law, he becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a law to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>By his workes God alſo is knowne; For the inviſible things of him, that is, his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:20885:93"/> power, and Godhead are knowne in the workes of his hands. Yet this is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſalvation: For the more a man knoweth of the works, except hee bee ſanctified, the more hee evaniſheth in the vanity of his owne imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and his fooliſh heart is the more repleniſhed with darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>By his word hee is knowne: for in the Law hee ſheweth what wee ought to doe, And in the goſpell what we ſhould beleeve. For the Law was but a pedagogue to Jeſus Chriſt: and all the ceremonies, figures, and types thereof, were but ſhadowes of things to come; the body was Jeſus Chriſt: and whoſoever in his difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath not recourſe to the Law, and to the teſtimony; it is becauſe there is neither light nor life in him.</p>
               <p>By grace God is knowne:
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:20885:93"/> for all the knowledge that man can have of God, either from the Law, or from the Goſpell, is in vaine, unleſſe our hearts bee inclined by the ſpirit of grace to obey, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve: for it is written, <hi>As many as are lead by the Spirit of God, are the Sonnes of God, and heires of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By glory wee ſhall know him fully: for here wee know but in part: but there we ſhall ſee as wee are ſeene, and know as wee are knowne, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed to his image, from glory to glory, by the ſpirit of the Lord.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that God in his word willeth us to do, is to beleeve in him: for there is a faith that beleeveth God to be: there is a faith that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveth God to bee true: and there is a faith that beleeveth in God.</p>
               <p>Every faith is not a ſaving
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:20885:94"/> faith, this onely ſaveth, when we beleeve in God, and reſt upon him, for the life of our bodies: ſaying, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread:</hi> And for the life of our ſoules; ſaying, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our ſinnes.</hi> So that in faith there muſt bee three things, <hi>Senſus, aſſenſus, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priatio,</hi> ſenſe, aſſent, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation: Now it is the applying faith that ſaves, for it is written, <hi>Thy faith hath made thee whole.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of us in his word; is a ſanctified obedience of that which we know and beleeve. For it is written, <hi>This is the will of God, even your ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Againe, <hi>Be ye holy as I am holy, who hath called you.</hi> And againe, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, &amp;c.</hi> For it is not hee who cryeth <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> that ſhall enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, but hee that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:20885:94"/> knoweth the will of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and doth it.</p>
               <p>It is the will of God that wee ſuffer for him, for it is written, <hi>Let him that would follow me deny himſelfe, and take up his croſſe and follow mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Brethren this is a leſſon the hardeſt of all for man to learn, concerning God, for man would learne to know God out of curioſity, that he might diſpute and reaſon concerning him. Man would beleeve both Gods word, and Gods worke out of neceſſity, when they cannot better do: Like <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Magicians confeſſing the finger of God.</p>
               <p>Man alſo, out of cuſtome, &amp; for civill ſhame, will ſome time obey God for feare of puniſhment, more then for fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liall affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but let theſe all be knit together, they ſhall not ſo evidently demonſtrate the life of the Chriſtian, as by his
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:20885:95" rendition="simple:additions"/> patience under the Croſſe. Looke to <hi>Ely,</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> to <hi>Iob,</hi> to the Diſciples, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, who ſuffered not onely the loſſe of their name, and the ſpoyle of their goods, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo rejoyced that they were counted worthy to ſuffer for the teſtimony of Jeſus: Looke to Jeſus Chriſt in his agony, <hi>Not my will, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Laſt of all, becauſe theſe things, O man, cannot be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor made ſo perfect in thee as they ſhould be: yet if thou canſt ſigh for thy deliverance, and groane under the burthen of thy imperfection, it is an evident aſſurance, that hee who hath begunne that work of grace in thee, will in due time perfect it; for theſe ſighs are not from nature, but from the Spirit of grace, for of our ſelves wee know nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how to pray, nor what to pray, but the ſpirit helpeth
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:20885:95"/> our infirmities, and maketh requeſt in us, with ſighs which cannot be expreſſed.</p>
               <p>But thou wilt ſay to mee, I have ſighed, and groaned, &amp; yet I have had no audience: I anſwer thee, there is no reaſon why thou ſhouldeſt bee ſo heard: thy ſinne hath dwelt long in thee, and thou art but chaſtiſed of late, and from yeſterday. Is it reaſon, that when thou cryeſt in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of thy ſoule, either for health or heaven, that thou ſhouldeſt bee immediately o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed? No, no, God called long at the dore of thy heart, but thou wouldeſt not heare him, why then ſhould hee ſo ſuddenly heare thee? I tell thee it is not onely patience, but exerciſe in patience that doth the turne.</p>
               <p>Againe, he hath more then reaſon to refuſe thee: for thou ſeekeſt to him, not ſo much
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:20885:96"/> for the deſire of glory, as to bee eaſed of thy ſmart, and therefore hee dealeth with thee, as with <hi>Ionah,</hi> that thou mayeſt ſay with <hi>Simeon, Lord, let thy ſervant depart in peace, for mine eyes have ſeene my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>

               <p>IN the handling of this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wee have already ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of two things, firſt of the word <hi>Will,</hi> and ſecondly, <hi>bee done:</hi> Wee muſt now come, and looke to the word <hi>Thy;</hi> and in it conſider whoſe will muſt bee done, For under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hereof, wee muſt know, that <hi>will</hi> is only, truly, &amp; properly attributed &amp; aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to three: to ſathan, to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:20885:96"/> man, and to God: I ſpeake of will, as it is a faculty of the reaſonable ſoule: and ſo do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from it, the unreaſonable creature: to whom appetite and deſire may be aſſigned, but a will cannot truly bee aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. To return then. Sathan is the firſt to whom will is aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in Scripture, for to him are applyed the words of the Prophet <hi>Iſay.</hi> 14.13. <hi>I will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into heaven, and I will exalt my ſelfe:</hi> above the ſtarres of God; as ſome expound. But by abuſe of this his will, hee hath captived it, both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his will to evill, and in ſo doing hath loſt the true priviledge of his will: For howſoever hee willeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that which is evill: yet he getteth not done, all the evill that he willeth: for God hath ſo thruſt a bridle in his lips, &amp; a hooke in his noſtrels, that without the bounds, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:20885:97"/> limits of his chaine, he neither dare nor can go 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> Man hath a title of a will aſcribed to him: for as hee is a reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, conſiſting of a ſoule and a body: ſo alſo in his ſoule there are theſe three things.</p>
               <p>An underſtanding, holding forth light to him: ſome affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions delighting more or leſſe in their object according to the light w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is premonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And a will, choſing or refuſing freely, the object ſet before him: both according to the light of his underſtanding, &amp; the delight of his affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid, that man wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth freely, for unleſſe <hi>will</hi> had the liberty &amp; free ſcope there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it were no more a willing, but a nilling power: it were not <hi>voluntas,</hi> but <hi>noluntas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now concerning this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or freedome in mans will, the Church of Rome, and we have had, and do ſtill as yet,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:20885:97"/> maintaine a long and ſerious debate, yet not concerning the freedome, and liberty of the will, but concerning the object, which the will of man chuſeth or refuſeth. It is their errour to alleage, that man in the ſtate of corruption, can will good, and will it freely: But wee on the contrary, do averre, that man in the ſtate of corruption can onely will evill, and that continually.</p>
               <p>For clearing of this truth, and that wee may bring the light of God out of this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; Wee muſt firſt conſider the ſeverall and different eſtates in the which man hath lived, doth live, or ſhall live.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how farre his will did freely extend it ſelfe to good, or evill, in theſe ſeverall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures or conditions of eſtate. When I looke on the eſtate &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition of man, I find it three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</p>
               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:20885:98"/>
               <p>Firſt, an eſtate of integrity.</p>
               <p>Secondly an eſtate of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, and an eſtate of reparation.</p>
               <p>His eſtate of integrity, is that, in the which he was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the image of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfectly righteous, and holy in ſoule, and body.</p>
               <p>His eſtate of corruption, is that wofull eſtate of ſinne, and miſery, in the which hee involved himſelfe by his apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacie from God.</p>
               <p>His eſtate of redinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration, is that happy eſtate to the which hee is exalted in Jeſus Chriſt, whilſt by the vertue of his death, and the power of his reſurrection, hee is made partaker of the grace of God in this life, and ſhall be alſo of his glory in the life to come.</p>
               <p>Now theſe being the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall eſtates, and conditions of
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:20885:98"/> man: the queſtion is, what is the true, onely, or adequate object of the will of man, good or evill.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer: good is threefold: There is a naturall good, a morall good, and a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall good.</p>
               <p>The naturall good, is that which ſerveth for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the naturall life: ſuch are eating, and drinking, ſleep, reſt or refreſhment.</p>
               <p>The morall good, is that which preſerves the morall life, or civill ſociety of men: ſuch are, to be a Judge, to bee a Magiſtrate, a Merchant, an Artiſan, a Trafiquer, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Spirituall good, is that which ſerveth for the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and preſerving of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life in man: Of this ſort are the preaching of the word, the adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, prayer, meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:20885:99"/>
               <p>Now, if it ſhall be enquired, which of theſe goods, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man, by the power of nature can freely will.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that in the eſtate of integrity hee willed them all: In the eſtate of his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he may will, and do the firſt two, but not the laſt: In the eſtate of grace he willeth the laſt, yet not freely, for God muſt firſt renew his will before hee can will any ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall good: And when hee hath willed it, it is not fully and abſolutely willed, or done as it becomes him: for the law of his body ſtriveth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the law of his minde, and captivates him to death. In the eſtate of glory, wee ſhall onely, and continually will that which is good, and ſpiritually good: for there wee ſhall bee exchanged into his image, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus the truth ſtands cleere;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:20885:99"/> That the naturall man, as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man, and before hee bee renewed by grace, can and may will both naturall good, and a morall good: But, to will a ſpirituall good in that meaſure, as that it may bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, hee neither can nor may: For howſoever he may preach, diſtribute the Sacraments, give almes, pray, and meditate: yet are theſe not acceptable, <hi>For the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man knoweth not the things that are of God.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <hi>Hee is dead in his ſins and treſpaſſes. Epheſ.</hi> 2. <hi>Hee hath not the ſonne of God, and therefore can have no life in him.</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Hee hath not the spirit of God in him, and therefore cannot be the child of God. Rom.</hi> 8.14.</p>
               <p>And finally, although his workes were finiſhed from the foundation of the world, yet is hee but a ſtranger from the life of God: For till his
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:20885:100"/> perſon bee firſt acceptable in Jeſus Chriſt, his workes ſhall never be approved.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, a Sathan hath a will, and: as man hath a will, ſo God alſo hath a will: And to him chiefly and above all, yea moſt truly, and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly is the liberty of will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. For hee willeth that which is good, and that moſt freely, moſt ſolely, moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, and moſt perfectly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe continually. Gods will then, yea, and his revealed will being holy, righteous, and juſt in it ſelfe, and of it ſelfe; is that only which wee crave in this Petition.</p>
               <p>But thou wilt perhaps aske me, may I not ſay, my will be done: No, no, for as God is <hi>primumens, &amp; primum agens,</hi> ſo is he alſo <hi>Liberrimumens, &amp; Liberrimum agens;</hi> Hee is the firſt eſſence, and the firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and hee is the freeſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:20885:100"/> and freeſt agent that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was. No creature in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or in earth, hath either a being, action, or will: but that which is duely and truely ſubordinated to his Eſſence, action, or will.</p>
               <p>Wouldeſt thou then crave a reaſon why thou muſt not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixe thy will with Gods will. The reaſons are theſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. As thou art a naturall man, there is great enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt thy will and Gods will. The Apoſtle tells us this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>The wiſedome of the naturall man is enmity with God.</hi> Hee ſaith not only, that it is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to it, but enmity it ſelfe Now we know that it is more to be enmity, then to bee an enemy, for an enemy may bee reconciled, but enmity ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is not good that wee ſay, my will bee done: For if we get our will, wee would
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:20885:101"/> many times will the things which would tend to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Thus the children of Iſrael willed and deſired Quailes in the wilderneſſe: and they got their will, but not their well: For when their meat was in their mouth it came out at their noſtrels.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If wee got all our will; wee ſhould many times ſinne againſt God, willing the things which hee willeth not, and nilling the things which he willeth. Thus did Iſrael will their returne to Aegypt againſt the will of God, leading them to the land of their reſt. And thus they would have a King, and got one in Gods anger.</p>
               <p>Thus I may ſay boldly, that mans will ſhould not bee ſought but Gods, For mans will differeth more from the will of God, then the heaven differeth from the earth. For
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:20885:101"/> it is mans will to live in wealth and proſperity, but God willeth it not, knowing that want is better for us, For when wealth maketh mans wit to waver, and proſperitie maketh him to misknow God: want maketh him wiſe, and with the prodigall child reclaimeth him from his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes live at randome, and be free from the Croſſe: but God willeth it not, for hee knoweth that without the yoake we are but wilde hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers: But when the Croſſe is on our backe, it will teach us to keepe his law.</p>
               <p>Finally, wee deſire to live long and ſee many dayes, God willeth it not: And therefore cutteth off the thred of our life, ſometimes in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſometimes in the noone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide, and ſometimes in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:20885:102"/> of our dayes. And by ſo doing preventeth the growth of ſinne in us. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſhutteth our eyes, from ſeeing the evil that is to come, and ſometimes draweth us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the love of the world, that wee may bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with our Maſters joy.</p>
               <p>Thus by all theſe palpable documents, hee cleerely tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth thee, to ſubmit thy will to his: and both in wealth and in want to ſay: Not my will but thy will be done.</p>
               <p>And truely, till this time come, and till thougrow up to this meaſure of grace: A Scholler thou may be in the Schoole of grace: but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man in Chriſt Jeſus thou art not: For he that would be his Diſciple muſt deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and take up his Croſſe and follow him dayly.</p>
               <p>The totall ſumme then, of this part of the Petition is this,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:20885:102"/> O Lord ſince by nature we are created to thy image, and ſince, in that eſtate of our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity we were ſufficiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to doe thy will: But now, ſince by our fall wee are ſo debilitated &amp; weakned, as that we can neither know thy will nor doe it; Wee runne to thee in the ſecret and ſincerity of our ſoules, And we begge of thee that by the grace of thy ſpirit, thou wouldeſt ſo reenable us, and ſtrengthen us againe, that thy will may not only bee done by us, but alſo upon us: That is to ſay, that we may not onely doe that which thou commandeſt us in thy word: but alſo patiently beare whatſoever croſſe or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity thou ſhalt bee pleaſed to exerciſe us with.</p>
               <p>And ſo having ended the firſt part of the Petition, wee come to the ſecond. The firſt part was materiall; the laſt is
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:20885:103"/> formall. <hi>Formatur,</hi> we craved that Gods will might be done in us and upon us. For manner we crave that his will may be done in earth as it is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>To come then to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration hereof: Whilſt our Redeemer preſcribeth unto us, the matter of Gods obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, he preſcribeth it in two ſubordinate periods of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the place thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the patterne thereof.</p>
               <p>The place, hee will have it done <hi>on earth:</hi> The patterne, <hi>As it is in heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We will firſt looke to the place of this obedience: And it is earth. By earth many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers men have meant many things diverſly. <hi>Tertullian</hi> by earth ſaid our body was meant and by heaven, our Soule: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our bodies are of the earth and earthly, and our
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:20885:103"/> Soules a ſpirituall and celeſtiall ſubſtance. And the ordinary gloſſe, following <hi>Tertulltan,</hi> writing on this place: by the earth have underſtood the fleſh, and by the Heaven the ſpirit: So that they make the meaning of the words to bee, Let the fleſh and the luſts thereof be ſubdued to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the good motions of the ſame.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyprian</hi> by earth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the unregenerate, and ſuch as doe not know God: and by Heaven, juſt men to whom God is knowne, and by whom he is obeyed. And he makes the meaning of the words to bee: Let them that are not yet called bee brought within the compaſſe of thy covenant, and the boſome of thy Church, that as wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, ſo they may beleeve al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: and as thy will is done by us, ſo it may bee done by them.</p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:20885:104"/>
               <p>Both of theſe opinions are not only tolerable but alſo laudable: For we are bound by religion, not only to ſubdue the luſts of our fleſh, and to live after the Spirit, but alſo wee are bound in charity, to begge of God, that all ſuch as appertaine to his election, may be in due time called, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, and glorified: That ſo there may be but one ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, and one ſheepfold, and God may bee over all, and in all, bleſſed for ever.</p>
               <p>But if I may ſpeak it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the prejudice of ſo great lights: Howſoever both theſe Petitions be requiſite for the Chriſtian: yet doe not I thinke that either of them be here meant: But with <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> I doe thinke that this Petition differs nothing, from that precept of the Apoſtles. <hi>Colloſ.</hi> 3.1. <hi>If yee bee riſen with Ieſus Chriſt, ſeeke thoſe things
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:20885:104"/> that are above.</hi> By earth then I underſtand men that are on earth: and by heaven, the Angels of God, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of good and juſt men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted: So that the meaning of the petition is: Since it hath pleaſed thee O Father, who dwelleſt in Heaven, to make thy name knowne to us, and be called upon of us: And ſeeing thou haſt honored us by the making us members of thy true Church, and thy Kingdome of grace here on earth: O let thy Spirit of Grace dwel ſo powerfully and plentifully in us, that as thy holy Angells and glorified Saints doe thy will in heaven: So we that are but weake and ſinfull men may captivate our wils to thy obedience here on earth.</p>
               <p>Well then, by Earth wee muſt underſtand not only earthly men, but alſo the place,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:20885:105"/> where, Even on earth, and while we live in it. But let us remarke the word, for it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. Our Saviour teaching us the perſon, the time, and the place of Gods obedience: ſaith not, Thy will be done in the field; in the city, in the ſea, or in the dry land, but <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> that is to ſay <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>per univerſum terrarum orbem,</hi> Through all the whole world: And as <hi>David</hi> ſayes in his 97. <hi>Pſalme: Make thy way knowne on earth, and thy ſaving health to all Nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The perſons then by whom he will have Gods will done, are men, who are of the earth, and to the earth returne again. And the place where, in the earth, and whilſt wee live in it: For unleſſe wee doe the will of God here, wee ſhall not enter into our Maſters joy hereafter.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond roome wee
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:20885:105"/> muſt looke to the patterne, and it is called heaven, by the which, as I told you already, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> do underſtand the holy Angells of God, and the glorified Spirits of men: Theſe are ſaid to bee in heaven. But by theſe alone the word is not only underſtood: For as there are more heavens then one, ſo are they more that do the will of God in heaven, then thoſe bleſſed Spirits alone. I ſay there are more heavens then one, and it is cleere: For it is ſaid in the preface of this prayer. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the plurall number: and it is knowne and manifeſt in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For this expanſum, or void wherein are the fowles, is called a heaven, and they, the fowles of the heaven. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, theſe ſeaven ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſpheares in the which the ſeaven Planets doe raigne are
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:20885:106"/> called heaven alſo. Againe, that place wherein are the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed Starres, is called a heaven alſo. And finally, that place of felicity, which is above all of theſe is called heaven, and the third heaven, and the heaven of heavens, and the Paradiſe of God. Now as all of theſe are furniſhed with their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall hoſt and inhabitants: So is the will of God done in all of theſe, by their ſeverall hoſt and inhabitants: For in the lower heavens, which we call our firmament, the will of God is done by the fowles of the ayre, and by the treaſures of windes, raine, ſnow, haile, and the thunder. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond heaven the will of God is done by the Sunne, the Moone, and the Starres. In the third heaven alſo the will of God is done by the holy Angells, who have kept their originall integrity, and by the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:20885:106"/> congregation of the firſt born, who reſt from their labours and have entred into their Maſters joy.</p>
               <p>The words then are cleere. By earth, is meant man, made of earth, returning to the earth, and living on the earth. By heaven, is meant all the hoſt and inhabitants of the whole heavens of God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be the firſt, ſecond, or third heaven: But chiefly the third.</p>
               <p>Now the reſemblance and parallel of the obedience is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable <hi>As it is in Heaven:</hi> For it may be enquired, how doe the Angells and Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted obey the will of God in heaven.</p>
               <p>I anſwere, they obey it five manner of wayes: Speedily, Cheerfully, Fully, ſincerely, conſtantly and perfectly. Speedily and without delay; cheerfully and without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:20885:107"/> fully and without omiſſion, ſincerely without diſſimulation, conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wearying, and perfectly without halting.</p>
               <p>Now, is it poſſible for man ſo to doe Gods will?</p>
               <p>No certainly: wee cannot doe it ſpeedily, for like <hi>Lot</hi> we linger to goe out of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: We cannot doe it cheerfully, for like Iſrael wee grudge, and murmur in the way to our reſt: We cannot doe it fully, for the good that wee would doe, we doe not, &amp;c. We doe it not ſincerely and without diſſimulation, for although wee honour him with our mouthes, our hearts are farre from him: We doe it not conſtantly and without wearying, for to day we are fervent, and to morrow wee are lukewarme, neither hot nor cold: Neither doe we it perfectly, for we know but in
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:20885:107"/> a part, and ſee but in a part, and our perfection is laid up for us, in the life to come.</p>
               <p>But why doe we then pray for it, ſince wee cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to it?</p>
               <p>I anſwere, though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attaine to it, yet wee ſhould ſtrive after it: For there is a time comming wherein we ſhall obtaine and attaine to that perfection wee aime at: And that is our laſt moment, and day of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution: Like Iſrael com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing Jericho: And <hi>Sampſon</hi> groaning under his blindneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</label> Now the uſe of all this. When God made man, he made him conforme to his patterne, for he made him like to himſelfe, and to his owne Image. When God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to build him a Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, he gave a patterne to it in the mount, and never a pinne was in the Tabernacle but
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:20885:108"/> what was commanded. So it is here, when Chriſt Jeſus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth us to doe Gods will; he writeth to us a copy, doe it in earth as it is done in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: Not that we are able to attaine to it, but that we muſt ſtrive after it.</p>
               <p>Let us looke but to a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Parent: Hee calleth upon his young infant to come, the child cannot goe, but creepeth to him: He calleth on him by his name: the child cannot ſpeake, but he bableth: Hee biddeth him ſtand upright and alone; but he ſtraight fals: Yet the father doth not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his obedience by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, but by the endeavour. It is ſo with God, Hee calleth upon us to come to him: wee cannot come unleſſe wee bee drawne. He biddeth us ſtand ſtedfaſt, but wee fall, till he ſtrengthen us. He biddeth us call upon him, but wee cannot
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:20885:108"/> till he firſt call upon us; and ſay (as to <hi>Mary</hi>) <hi>Mary,</hi> then ſtraight we anſwere him <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bony.</hi> Finally, hee biddeth us doe his will on earth as it is in heaven, and be perfect as he is perfect: But we cannot, till he firſt give us the thing that he craveth of us. What ſhall wee then doe, ſhall wee lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh becauſe wee are weake, or retire becauſe we are faint? No, let us creepe, and bable, and ſtruggle: We are accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not becauſe of our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, but becauſe of our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: Not becauſe of our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but becauſe of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Coll.</hi> 3.2.</p>

               <p>HAving ſpoken of the firſt three Petitions, which concerne the honour and glory of God: It reſteth now, that we looke on thoſe Petitions which concern man, and his utility, either bodily or ſpiritually. It is bodily wants are poured out here in this Petition, and the ſupport and reliefe thereof petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>In handling hereof, wee ſhall obſerve the very ſame order and Method, which we obſerved in the former: For firſt we will looke to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of this Petition: and next to the matter compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended therein. The cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is remarkable: For the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:20885:109"/> Petition lookes with a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold aſpect: <hi>viz.</hi> a reference to the former Petitions: and a relation to the enſuing. The reference it hath to the firſt three Petitions, is, that it ſerves for a touchſtone, to try the right and true title which wee have to the things of this life: For wee live in a world wherein there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which men doe ſo much affect as plenty and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance: And there is no man ſo much abhorred and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as the poore man and hee that wants: Howſoever it be abſolutely true, that the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of man conſiſts not in the poſſeſſion of the earth, or earthly things (for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God ſtandeth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Meat, Drinke, nor Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell, but in Righteouſneſſe, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.) But wouldeſt thou know O man, whether thou
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:20885:110"/> haſt a true title and right to the things that thou poſſeſſeſt, or not, and wouldſt thou know whether or not thou enjoyeſt and brookes them with a good conſcience: Then for thy reſolution, looke to the firſt three Petitions, and ſee how farre they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken root in thy heart, and how farre thy heart hath beene ſet on their obedience: So farre thou haſt right, and true title to the things of this life, and no farther: For I will aſſure thee unleſſe Gods honour hath beene deare to thee, and dearer then thy owne: Unleſſe Gods Kingdome hath beene dearer to thee then all the world beſides: Yea and all the world in thy accompt hath beene but loſſe to thee, in reſpect of it: And finally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Gods will have beene ſo deare to thee, that thou haſt denyed thy ſelfe, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:20885:110"/> the Croſſe patiently, captivating thy will to Gods: I will tell thee thus much, an uſe of the creatures of God thou mayeſt have had, but a true title or right to them thou never hadſt: And to ſpeake it in one word, an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper of Gods creatures thou maiſt bee, but a true owner thou never waſt. No I muſt tell thee more: There is never a bitt of bread that goeth downe into thy belly, nor one drop of water that goeth into thy mouth, but ſhall one day accuſe thee of the wrong and tyranny that thou haſt done: unleſſe thou canſt ſhew by thy charter that thou art a member of Gods Kingdome: And that for thy <hi>Reddendo</hi> thou haſt honored his name, and captivated thy will to his obedience, For as all things are ours whilſt wee are Chriſts: So without Chriſt nothing in
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:20885:111"/> the world is ours: No, they are ſo farre from being ours, that they ſigh and groane a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. And woe bee to us, if when they ſigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, wee cannot ſigh for our ſelves. But this is not all, For as this hath a reſpect to the former Petitions, by way of tryall, ſo doth it alſo carry a reference and relation to the ſubſequent, and that more wonderfull and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable then the former: For it may bee enquired whence it commeth, that hee who was the Son of God, and thought it no robbery to bee made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with God himſelfe: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, whence it was, that he who laid downe the life of his body, that hee might ſave the life of our ſoules: And finally, whence it comes, that hee who did forbid us to care what wee ſhould eate, or what apparrell we ſhould put
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:20885:111"/> on: ſhould in this meaſure be ſo carefull of our bodies, and the naturall life thereof, that he ſhould preferre a petition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the body, before that which concerneth the ſoule.</p>
               <p>Is not the ſoule of much more worth then the body, and are not the things, that concerne the ſoule of farre greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, then thoſe which concerne the body?</p>
               <p>How is it then, that hee who is the Prince of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, ſhould bee thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous in his Alphabet as to recommend to us the care of our bodies before the care of our ſoules: and the worth of a peece of bread, before the worth of the remiſſion of our ſinnes?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, Wiſdome is juſtified of all her children: and therefore it becomes us not to judge any thing before the time, for hee is the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:20885:112"/> of the Father, who hath thus taught us, and as there was no iniquity found in his wayes, ſo there was no guile found in his tongue.</p>
               <p>Hee hath then ſuffered us to prefixe the Petition which concerneth our body, before thoſe that concerne our ſoule: not for dignities, but for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities ſake: For behold, as hee made us, ſo hee knoweth our frame, and of what mould wee are made: and for this cauſe hee ſubmitteth himſelfe to our infirmities: that by doing ſo he may gaine us; for wee have not ſuch an High-prieſt, as cannot bee touched with the ſenſe of our infirmities: but who was made like unto us in all things, ſinne excepted.</p>
               <p>Will any man then aske the reaſon of this order, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, God hath done it wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for three cauſes.</p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:20885:112"/>
               <p>Firſt, to ſhew us the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of our fleſh, or fleſhly nature.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to ſhew us the riches of his mercy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to ſhew us the true refuge to the which wee ſhould runne in the day of our bodily wants.</p>
               <p>I ſay, firſt, it is done to ſhew us our naturall infirmity, and the weakneſſe of fleſh; who live by ſenſe, and not by faith: For it is with man, (walking in the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) as it is with little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, walking in their parents families: wee know this to be the defect, and weakneſſe of our children: that hardly, or ſeldome can they bee brought to put on their appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, or ſay their prayers till firſt they get the promiſe of their breakfaſt: it is ſo with us in the way to heaven; all the promiſes of God (concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:20885:113"/> our felicity there) which in themſelves are ſo large, and infinite: that neither hath the eye ſeene them, or the eare heard them, or can the minde of man underſtand them: Yet all of them, of what quality, or number ſoever they bee: can never lead a man to the earneſt purſuit of thoſe things that are eternall, unleſſe hee get a palpable poſſeſſion of thoſe things that are tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. But as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>This is our death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſayſecondly, he hath done it for a demonſtration of the riches of his mercy towards us, letting us ſee that hee will paſſe by many of our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and overlooke many of our weakeneſſes ere hee want us; (So pretious a thing in the eyes of the Lord is the Soule of a man, that hee will give much for it ere hee want it) looke to the Father, looke
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:20885:113"/> to the Sonne, to the Holy Ghoſt, looke to the elect an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, to the Saints departed, to the ſenſeleſſe creatures, and looke to ſathan himſelfe, and all ſhall teach you, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on earth is ſo pretious as the ſoule of man.</p>
               <p>And if our ſoules, and the redemption of them, bee a matter of ſo great excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; doe you thinke that God will want it for a meale of meat? no, no, farre bee it from us to thinke ſo: for will hee that feeds the fowles of the aire, and clothes the lillies in the field, be forgetfull of us? No ſurely, a haire of our head ſhall not fall to the ground, but by his providence, and if any ſhall fall, it is not for want of his favour, but for the weakneſſe of our faith.</p>
               <p>I ſay thirdly, it is done to ſhew us the true refuge, unto the which we ſhould all leane
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:20885:114"/> in the day of our want, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bodily or ſpirituall: and that is onely to God: For will wee looke to the things of this earth in the day of our bodily want: from whom ſhall we ſeeke them but from God, for it is hee that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the heaven, and maketh the heaven to heare the earth, and the earth to heare the come, and the come to heare Iſrael.</p>
               <p>If hee heare thee, all ſhall heare thee, but if hee ſtop his eare, all ſhall bee deafe and dumbe to thee: For the eyes of all things do wait, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on him: While he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his hand, they are filled with his bleſſing: But if hee over-cloud his countenance, they are ſore affraid, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</p>
               <p>Now this being the reaſon of the coherence, I come to the Petition, wherein ſix
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:20885:114"/> things are remarkable.</p>
               <p>Firſt, what we crave, <hi>Bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, of whom wee crave it, of God; for wee ſay, <hi>Give.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, to whom wee crave it: and it it not in the ſingular number to mee, or to thee but in the plurall number, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, what a bread it is that we crave, a <hi>Daily bread,</hi> not a dainty bread.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, whoſe bread is it that we crave: not our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours bread, but our owne, <hi>Our.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſixtly, for what time it is that wee crave it, not for the morrow, but for to day. <hi>Give us this day our daily bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt I looke on the thing that is petitioned, <hi>Bread:</hi> It is requiſite that I ſearch, what is meant, and underſtood by it. The Ancients and Fathers of the Church have thought di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:20885:115"/> of it. <hi>Tertullian lib. de Orat. Cap.</hi> 6. will have by this bread, Chriſt himſelfe to bee meant: and ſaith that there is nothing can have a more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly progreſſe, then that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we have ſought the honor of Gods name, the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Kingdome, and the obedience of his will: to ſeeke alſo the bread of life, by the which wee may bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to do thoſe things. And this is Chriſt himſelfe (ſaith hee) for of him it is written, <hi>I am the bread of life. Ioh.</hi> 6. <hi>Athanaſius lib. De humana na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura ſuſcepta. Tom.</hi> 1. doth by the word <hi>bread</hi> underſtand the Holy Ghoſt: and for proofe thereof, bringeth the words of this very Text <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Our daily bread:</hi> for hee ſaith, God hath taught us in this preſent time, to ſeeke that bread for our entertainment, whoſe firſt fruits ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:20885:115"/> our ſoule in life, to the life to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> writing of the ſermon of Chriſt in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. <hi>Tom.</hi> 4. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. <hi>pag.</hi> 349. by bread doth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the bread of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, or elſe the bread of Gods word: by the which our ſoules are kept in life to the obedience of his ſtatutes.</p>
               <p>But with reverence let me ſay, that <hi>Tertullians</hi> opinion (meaning by bread, Chriſt) cannot ſtand with the due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this prayer: for then it were tautologick, for that was ſought in the petition, <hi>Thy Kingdome come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation cannot bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, whilſt by bread hee meaneth the holy Ghoſt: for of him wee receive but the firſt fruits in this life: But of this bread we many times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:20885:116"/> both ſatiety and ſurfeit.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, I cannot ſubſcribe to <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in this his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor to the Rhemiſts his followers, who by bread here underſtand the bread of the Sacrament, for if it were ſo, I ſee no reaſon wherefore they ſhould debarre the laicks from eating thereof, one licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating the uſe thereof to the Prieſts, whilſt God calleth it our bread, and our daily bread, and alloweth to us both the uſe, and the daily uſe thereof.</p>
               <p>It reſteth then, that the truth bee cleared, and ſo it ſhall by taking the words li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally, and under the name of bread by underſtanding ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers bread, yet not ſo ſtrictly but that figuratively alſo, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it we may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend all things requiſite for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of this our naturall life: ſuch as are, ſtrength of body by nouriſhment, health
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:20885:116"/> by Phyſick, warmneſſe by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, ſufficiencie, and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondencie to our labours: and finally, all the meanes and helpes that leads to theſe things: as Chriſtian magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, peace in the land, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable weather, So that <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> looking on the large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the word bread, ſayeth of this Petition; <hi>Haec poſtulatio maxima eſt corum quae petuntur.</hi> For ſince, as man cannot live without bread, ſo his bread cannot quicken him except he have a ſtomack to diſgeſt, and when his ſtomack is able, hee cannot get it, unleſſe the earth afford it: and the earth doth not afford it except it be laboured: and it cannot bee laboured except there bee peace amongſt men: and in the very time of peace, mens tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels cannot be profitable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe God ſend both the firſt and the latter raine: Therefore
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:20885:117"/> ſaith hee, in this one word of bread, many things are couched, yea all things that are requiſite for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of our life.</p>
               <p>The meaning of the words being thus interpreted, let us make ſome uſe of them. Their uſe is twofold.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</label> For the word ſerves firſt for rebuke, and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for inſtruction. It ſerves for rebuke to the Church of Rome, who by the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of their extraordinary, and unneceſſary faſtings, hope to enter into the kingdome of God: But to thoſe I ſay, yet not I, but Jeſus Chriſt for me: <hi>Fooles and hypocrites, you make cleane the outer ſide of the cup and the platter, but within all is foule, and full of ravening.</hi> Foole, doſt thou thinke that the kingdome of God ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in meate, and drinke, or in apparell? No, no, it ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:20885:117"/> in righteouſneſſe, peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt. What careth God I pray thee, for a bit of meat, that goeth into thy belly, or for that rag of clothes, that covereth thy nakedneſſe? When he is hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry will he tell thee? or when hee is thirſty, will hee that thou ſhouldeſt give him drinke? or if he were cold, or naked, would hee begge the uſe of thy garment? No ſurely, thoſe things are not for him, but for us, and for our uſe: Hee made our bodies of the earth, earthly: hee hath breathed the breath of life in our noſtrils, that by it wee may live in the body: he hath given us alſo the uſe of his creatures, for the preſervation of that ſparke, till hee recall it.</p>
               <p>What is it then ſhould make man ſo bold to inhibit the uſe of that thing which
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:20885:118"/> God hath licenced, or what art thou, O man, that dareſt pollute that which God hath ſanctified to thee? Well hath the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> fore-prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of thee; that in ſo doing thou haſt a ſhew of godlineſſe, but in effect thou haſt denyed the power thereof: for theſe things may have a ſhew of wiſdome in a will-worſhip and neglect of the body, but in effect they are but the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world, and the ordinances, and traditions of men: for they hold not of our head which is Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>I graunt indeed it fareth not with the ſoule, and the body, as it fareth betwixt an evill matched man, and his wife: the thing that the one wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, the other willeth not: and if any neighbour ſhall pacifie the ſtrife with reaſon, hee hath gained a ſoule: It is even ſo with the matter of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:20885:118"/> faſting: if, whilſt the fleſh lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit fighteth againſt the fleſh, wee can beate downe our bodies, and bring them in ſubjection, it is more then requiſite: But if wee ſhall think hypocritically, by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to merit or procure to our ſelves the Kingdome of heaven, wee deceive our ſoules, and our labour is in vaine: for the kingdome of God ſtandeth neither in meat, drinke, or apparell; but in righteouſneſſe, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2.</label> And as it ſerves for rebuke of the Church of Rome, ſo doth it alſo for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to our reformed Church: and that in a twofold manner: for it teacheth a leſſon to the rich man, and another alſo to the poore man.</p>
               <p>It teacheth the rich man to eſchew covetouſneſſe, for if
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:20885:119"/> God give him bread, hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him all that hee oweth him: wee cannot bee content till our table be richly decked, and our cup overflow: but alas theſe things ought not to be ſo; for we came naked into the world, and naked we ſhall returne againe. If wee get therefore food, and rayment, it becomes us therewith to be contented. Nature is not cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in herd yet, nor charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in her fare; ſhee can ſay with the Poët, <hi>Vivitur parvo bene,</hi> all that ſhe craveth, is but bread and water, a clout to cover her nakedneſſe, and a hole to hide her head in: when God ſendeth more, ſhe can uſe it with ſobriety, when God denyeth it, ſhee can bee thankfull, and ſay with <hi>Iob, The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken, &amp;c.</hi> And when ſhe ſeeth the beſt chear in the world ſet before her,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:20885:119"/> ſhe accounteth it all but bread.</p>
               <p>The crummes of the rich mans table was bread, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though refuſed to <hi>Lazarus:</hi> and the rich mans ſumptuous fare was but bread: <hi>Daniels</hi> pulſe and water was bread: and the Kings royall fare was but bread: the huskes of the ſwine was bread to the prodigall child, and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers feaſt was but bread.</p>
               <p>Thus the true chriſtian in all things is content: hee canne bee abaſed, and hee can abound: he can bee hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and he can bee full, he can want, and he can have. <hi>Philip.</hi> 4. And in the midſt of his fulneſſe, hee is carefull of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much, as that the Lord ſend not a leanneſſe u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his ſoule.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as it teacheth the richman to meaſure the things of this life, not by the ell of his deſires which have no
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:20885:120"/> end, but by the ell of nature, which is ſhort &amp; ſoone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented: ſo from this the poore man hath a leſſon of content. When hee looketh to his neighbour and ſeeth him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cloathed, better fed, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter followed, and better favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then himſelfe, truly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would grudge and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure in a naturall man: But if thou bee a chriſtian let mee exhort thee in the name of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, whoſe name is called upon by thee: repreſſe theſe fond imaginations: Conſider that God hath taken nothing from thee, but what hee gave thee: And that in wiſdome, hee hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thee ſhort of thoſe things that hee himſelfe may be thy portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Bleſſed art thou if he be ſo to thee. It may be for a time thou hunger and thirſt, but thou ſhalt bee ſatisfied: and it may be for a time that thou mourne and weepe, but thou
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:20885:120"/> ſhalt be comforted, The way to procure thy content, it not to meaſure thy want with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens wealth: No, no, but looke to the woe that their wealth hath bred them, and conſider how eaſe, and fulneſſe of bread hath made their hearts fat, and hath lulled them into the lethargie of a giddie minde, whilſt by means of thy want, God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his life in thy ſoule. Wouldſt thou then change eſtates? no, doe not if thou be wiſe: for they who poſſeſſe thoſe things, ſtand in ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery places, they ſeldome or never leave their owners without a fall.</p>
               <p>How many this day are in hell, who would goe naked to bee partakers of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of righteouſneſſe: who would be ſtill hungry to get a poore crumme of the booke of life: and dye a thouſand
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:20885:121"/> deaths for thirſt, to get one drop of that water, that could coole the heate of that flame which they ſuſtaine: but oh! they cannot obtaine it: they have loſt their time, and their judgement is ſealed.</p>
               <p>While therefore thou haſt time, in time, redeeme the time, for the daies are evill: and if thou get food and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, learne therewith to be content: and if thou be greedy of any thing in the world, be greedy of grace: for if thou haſt the grace of God, thou art richer then <hi>Creſus:</hi> becauſe thou haſt Chriſt, who when hee was rich, became poore, that in his povertie thou mighteſt be made rich.</p>

                     <hi>Give us this day our daily bread.</hi>
                  </q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THe ſecond thing conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in theſe words is the perſon of whom wee aske this, and it is of God; for whilſt in the preface wee ſay, <hi>Our Father,</hi> behold here wee ſay to him, <hi>Give.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In handling of this word a ſupplication, wee have three things to conſider; Firſt, to whom it is powred out; to God; Secondly, after what manner; by way of begging. Thirdly, for what reaſon; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his command, <hi>Aske and you ſhall receive.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt thing remarkable in this word of the Petition, is, of whom wee crave our bread: and I ſee, it is of God. Will any man enquire why
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:20885:122"/> it is, that for every peece of bread wee put in our mouth, wee ſhould goe to God and aske it of him: this may ſeeme a little ſtrange: for there are many, that have more bread lying beſide them then they can get eaten, and many (like the rich man in the Goſpell) have more in ſtore then they can make uſe of.</p>
               <p>This may well then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the poore man; who when hee dineth in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning knoweth not where to ſuppe at night: or if hee have gotten a morſell of greene hearbs at night, knoweth not the next morning where to breake his faſt: I thinke it were no fault in him to goe to God, and to begge of him every bit and morſell of bread that goeth into his mouth: for a rich man dineth when he pleaſeth, but the poore man when he may.</p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:20885:122"/>
               <p>Yet to anſwer, I ſay, it is requiſite for the rich as well as for the poore, when hee ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth at table, to ſay, <hi>Give mee;</hi> and that for three cauſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for the honour of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for inſtruction of the owner, in the right title of the creature.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for his inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the remembrance of them that want: and in the uſe of the creature.</p>
               <p>I ſay, firſt, that it is done for the cleering of the honour of God, both that he openeth his eare and his hand for our deliverance from our meaneſt diſtreſſes.</p>
               <p>It was ſaid of old amongſt the Heathen of their God: <hi>non vacat exiguis rebus adeſſe Iovi:</hi> It is not ſo with our God, bleſſed bee his name: The meaneſt diſtreſſe that his ſervants could ever ſtand
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:20885:123"/> in, they never ſooner opened their mouth to cry, but ſtraight he bowed downe his eare and heard them. They could never ſooner preſent their wants before him, then he opened his hands, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them with his bleſſing. And if I ſhould be particular: what is it that God would not give him if hee ſeeke it of him. Man as a naturall man, hath a naturall life in him: which, as it is from God by inſpiration, ſo it muſt bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by God and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, till he recall it in his wiſedome. Hee gave it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were: he recalleth it before wee bee aware: but hee entertaineth it by making us ſenſible of our wants, and ſupplicants to him for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe. <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>As man is a naturall man, and hath the maintenance of his naturall life of God, ſo is
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:20885:123"/> he ordained by God to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, and propagate his peace on earth. Which if hee aske not of God, hee will not give it him: and unleſſe that God give it him he ſhall not have it. Looke to <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant, going for a wife to <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaak.</hi> and to <hi>Sampſon,</hi> ſeeking a wife amongſt the <hi>Philiſtims.</hi> Beſides this, peace is requiſite for the maintenance of mans life: and this hee cannot have except God give it. For as he is the Lord of hoſts, and the leader of our battailes, ſo is he the God of our peace alſo. It is he who in the day of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, can hiſſe for a flie againſt Aegypt; and for a Bee againſt Aſhur. <hi>Eſau.</hi> 7.18. So it is hee that breakes the Bow, and the Speare in Judah, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 40. and cryeth ſuch a peace to his people, that a covenant is made betwixt them and the ſtones of the field, neither is
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:20885:124"/> this all. For man, as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God, for his Gods ſake, may bee called to ſuffer. If in that day we call on him, will he leave us? No, no; hee hath forbidden us to care for our accuſations, for his Spirit in us ſhall ſpeake for us: and that with ſuch efficacy, and force of truth, that our adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries ſhall not bee able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt it. <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.19.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore, all our neceſſities are manifeſt before him, our teares in his bottle, the haires of our head in his hand, our ſupplications in his boſome, and our dayes in his regiſter: Why ſhould we in our diſtreſſe feare to draw neare to him: No, it is his honour that wee draw neere. For he hath ſaid, <hi>Come to mee all yee that are weary and heavy laden, and I will eaſe you.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Whoſoever comes to mee him I caſt not away: For the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:20885:124"/> Reed I will not breake, and the ſmoaking Flax I will not quench.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As it ſerves for the honour of God, to ſee his children come, and ſeeke a peece of bread of him, ſo it inſtructeth the children of God alſo, in the right uſe of the creature. For it is written, <hi>Man what haſt thou that thou haſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and if thou haſt received it, why glorieſt thou?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to make this a little more cleere: thou wilt finde, that in the uſe of the creature, thou hadſt need to goe to the Creator: and to ſay <hi>Give mee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>:</hi> and that for two cauſes. Firſt, thou canſt not attaine to it, unleſſe he give thee it: and next thou cauſt not have a bleſſing with it, unleſſe hee give it thee.</p>
               <p>Firſt, thou canſt not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, unleſſe he give it thee, For thou maiſt riſe early at
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:20885:125"/> 
                  <hi>Morne,</hi> goe late to bed at <hi>Night,</hi> and all the <hi>Day</hi> long eate the <hi>Bread of Sorrow:</hi> But all is in vaine, unleſſe God give the increaſe. Looke to all the things that are in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſee what the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man can doe to them for their conqueſt. I preſuppoſe thou art going to the ſea: canſt thou make the winde blow right in thy ſaile: thou canſt not. For if God would give every man his deſire in the winde, ſuch a confuſed whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde was never ſeene in the world: ſo as the whirlewinde that blew downe <hi>Iobs</hi> houſe, ſhould not bee like it. And therefore his windes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſit in thy face, another time in thy neighbours. And by ſo doing, and croſſing all your deſires, teacheth you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to depend on him. For it is he only that giveth. What I ſpeake to the ſeaman, I ſpeak
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:20885:125"/> to the husbandman, to the clowne, to the courtier. Yea what I ſpeake to one I ſpeake to all. It becommeth us in the uſe of the creature, to doe two things. Firſt to deny our ſelves, and then to runne to God. Firſt, deny thy ſelfe for thou art weake in a two-fold weakneſſe: weake in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and weake in power. In judgement, not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the things of God, which the naturall man knoweth not, but alſo concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſecrets of nature: which man knew once by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but knoweth not now by reaſon of his fall. Aske the Aſtrologue, the Soothſayer, the Necromancer, and all thoſe vaine ſearchers of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who doe ſow iniquity and reape vanity: <hi>And who asking counſell at their ſtock, have nothing but their ſtaffe to anſwere them. Hoſea</hi> 4.</p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:20885:126"/>
               <p>As we are weake in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to underſtand, ſo are we weake in power how to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, not only the things that are of God: but alſo the things that are of men.</p>
               <p>That wee cannot mannage the things that are of God it is cleere out of this example: <hi>David</hi> and Iſrael did purpoſe to bring up Gods Arke out of the houſe of <hi>Abinadab,</hi> in a new cart. 1. <hi>Chronicles</hi> 15.13. But becauſe they thought themſelves able enough to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that buſineſſe, without Gods direction: Looke to <hi>Perez <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> by the way: Looke alſo to Iſrael fighting againſt <hi>Benjamin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as it is in things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, ſo is it in things concerning us, for howſoever we have underſtanding to know what they are, yet we want wiſedome to mannage them aright: Looke to Iſrael,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:20885:126"/> who did ſow much, and reaped little, who did eate, and were not filled, who ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned wages but could never get a purſe to keepe them in. And in a word: except wee get both judgement to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne of the creature aright, and power to make a right uſe of it: Wee may ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt: our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells are caryed headlong: for wee meete with darkneſſe in the day. And for the ſecond, we may juſtly ſay with <hi>Peter, Wee have fiſhed all the night and yet have caught nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the laſt roome whileſt wee are commanded, to goe to God and to ſay to him, <hi>Give:</hi> Wee are taught to know how to uſe the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures aright, and that three manner of wayes. Firſt, by travell, ſecondly, by prayer, thirdly by charity.</p>
               <p>By travell becauſe man
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:20885:127"/> muſt eate his bread in the ſweate of his brow.</p>
               <p>In his innocency he was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to delve in the garden of God. When hee fell, the earth was accurſed for his ſake: And let him travell as he liketh, yet in the ſweat of his brow hee ſhall eate his bread, and in the uſe of a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full calling, he hath only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expect an anſwerable bleſſing.</p>
               <p>I ſay ſecondly hee muſt pray, for let him toile never ſo much, except he pray, he ſhall not ſpeed: For it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; <hi>Niſi Iehovah, fruſtra:</hi> and theſe two are ſurely knit to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, labour and prayer.</p>
               <p>For as ſighing without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and expectation without ſighing: as prayer in a tempeſt without toiling, and toile without prayer: and as in a Sermon, information of the underſtanding, without
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:20885:127"/> working on the affections, and travell on the affections, without information of the minde, is all in vaine. So alſo in things temporall, neither will our travell alone, nor our prayer alone, ſerve our neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities: but travell and prayer conjoyned together, make up the worke of our reliefe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly it teacheth us, how to commiſerate others in their neceſſities. For there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who like <hi>Nabal</hi> cannot yeeld to <hi>David:</hi> or like to the rich glutton, cannot pity <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus,</hi> or like a <hi>Iezebel,</hi> fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding foure hundred falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and yet can ſuffer <hi>Eliah</hi> to ſtarve. But in this O man, thou art deceived: For thou canſt not get it, till thou ſay to God, <hi>Give.</hi> And when hee giveth it thee, it is to this end amongſt many, that thou maieſt not refuſe him who ſaith to thee, <hi>Give,</hi> nor that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:20885:128"/> thou hide not thy eyes againſt thy owne fleſh: For a cuppe of cold water ſhall not want a reward.</p>
               <p>Adde to theſe our owne uſe in ſobriety: neither pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering our bodies to ſurfeit like the rich glutton: nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpecting them by nigardice: but uſing them in ſobriety: For the belly is for meate, and meate for the belly, but God will deſtroy them both.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</label> Now having ſpoken a little concerning the perſon of whom wee crave theſe things, and the reaſons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; make wee ſome few uſes thereupon, which are foure. Firſt, it ſerves to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the common opinion of Chance. Secondly, of merit. Thirdly, it treades downe our pride, And fourthly, it rebuketh our diſtruſt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire.</p>
               <p>I ſay firſt it confuteth
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:20885:128"/> chance: For howſoever the greater part of the world bee ignorant of the wayes of the moſt high, and attribute either their proſperity, or adverſity to chance or fortune, yet let the Chriſtian know, that this proceeds from the ignorance that is in them: For there is neither chance nor fortune in the world: but that God, who by the word of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er made the world, by the word of his providence go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth it, and by the word of his good pleaſure ſhall ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine it: hee dwelleth in the heavens: and doth upon the earth whatſoever hee will: that man may know that he it is, who woundeth and bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth up againe: who killeth and maketh alive: and who having exalted bringeth down againe to the duſt, and to the dung hill: and that beſide him there is no God: even beſides
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:20885:129"/> him, who is the God of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, and the holy One of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it confutes me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: for who art thou, O man, that dareſt bee bold to bragge of thy merit? canſt thou by thy merit, or the power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of make one haire of thy head white or blacke? canſt thou make the Sunne to ſhine, or the raine to fall upon the earth to give her increaſe? No; thou canſt not. How much leſſe art thou able to pay a ranſome for thy owne ſoule? No, no, alas, thou canſt not. It may be thou ſaiſt, that thou art rich and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed with goods &amp;c. but Lord open thy eyes to ſee thy pouerty and nakedneſſe: and with a temptation, the Lord give the iſſue to beare it.</p>
               <p>I ſay thirdly, that this word ſerveth to tread downe our pride: for of all the creatures of the world, man is borne
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:20885:129"/> the weakeſt and the moſt wretched. Other creatures fall no ſooner from the belly of their damme, but they can goe, eate, and are covered. Man is borne weak, wretched, unable to walke, unable to eate, and unable to cloath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: And when he hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten all that hee can poſſeſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sunne, what hath hee but what he borroweth? He borroweth food from the earth, clothes from the beaſts, riches out of the Mynes of the earth, wine and oyle from the trees: And yet hee is proud, as though all were his owne. But foole that thou art, why art thou ſo miſcaryed: Naked thou cameſt into the world, and naked thou ſhalt returne againe.</p>
               <p>If thou have therefore food and rayment, waxe not proud, for it is but a borrowed ſpoile thou art proud of, and if God
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:20885:130"/> ſhall ſtrippe thee naked of them, thou ſhalt know that all was but vanity, and that it is a fooliſh thing for man, to rejoyce in any thing but in this, that his name is written in the booke of life.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, it rebukes with a moderate griefe, for the want of the things of this life. We are to day ſtrong, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row weake: to day beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to morrow deformed: to day honourable, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row deſpiſed, to day rich, and to morrow poore: And in all theſe our eſtates no further changed, then our minds are. As long as the Halcyan dayes of our eaſe and proſperity do laſt, we over-joy our joyes: and we ſay with <hi>David, Our eſtate ſhall never bee moved:</hi> But if God change our porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, our minde is ſtraight chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: Wee are with <hi>David, ſore afraid.</hi> and as <hi>Paul</hi> telleth
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:20885:130"/> us, <hi>Wee murmur as thoſe who have no hope.</hi> But out upon ſuch a weakneſſe, it is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent teſtimony that wee are altogether carnall, and as yet in our ſinnes. If our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge were better, our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould bee bettered alſo: and if wee ſhould once make the Lord our portion, wee ſhould be more glad to want the world then to have it: and to ſay with <hi>Iob, The Lord hath given and the Lord hath taken, &amp;c.</hi> And with the Apoſtle, <hi>I count all things but loſſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the advantage I have in the Croſſe of Ieſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus wee have ſpoken ſomething concerning the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the perſon to whom we ſay Give. The manner of the word is remarkable: For it is not a word of prevention: It is not a word of retaliation, it is only a word of ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and begging.</p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:20885:131"/>
               <p>That it is neither a word of preventio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor retaliation, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce from the Lawyers, who ſay (and that very well) that there are two ſorts of gifts: <hi>Donationum alia eſt ſimplex &amp; gratuita, alia co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditionata ob cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam futura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> When we come to God, and ſay to him, Give, It telleth us that we can neither preve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him by giving him any thing firſt or freely, nor yet, when hee hath given us any thing, can we repay him with any reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. We cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him by giving him firſt, for that were againſt his eternity: for it is written, <hi>Who hath give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him firſt, &amp; it ſhall be reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>penced.</hi> Neither can we give him free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for that were againſt his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency: <hi>For when hee is hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry he will not tell us, &amp;c. And the earth is the Lords, &amp; the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture thereof.</hi> Againe, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give him by way of remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or requitall: <hi>Abra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:20885:131"/> he came to ſojourne in the land of Canaan, although all the land was his by promiſe, yet did hee poſſeſſe nothing thereof but a place to bury his dead: and that hee bought from <hi>Ephron</hi> the Hittite for thirtie peeces of ſilver, even the cave of <hi>Maghpelae. David</hi> at the returne of the Arke, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the floore of <hi>Araunah</hi> the Jebuſite: and yet by way of requitall <hi>(I will ſurely buy it of thee at a price.)</hi> The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Aegypt in the time of famine, received bread from <hi>Ioſeph:</hi> but they paid well for it: when their money failed them, they excambed their flocks, and when their flocks failed, they ſold their land, and their inheritance alſo.</p>
               <p>But here is no ſuch dealing betwixt God and us, hee is the giver and we are the beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: Hee giveth firſt, For he knew, choſe, and loved us,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:20885:132"/> before wee were. He giveth abundantly, <hi>Wine to make the heart glad, and oyle to make the face to ſhine.</hi> Hee giveth freely alſo, for wee have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to give backe againe, and he dealeth with us as <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> dealt with his Brethren: when we open our ſacks, wee finde our monies in the mouth of them reſtored again. Hee will not make Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe with us: For his houſe is not a houſe of Merchandiſe, but a houſe of prayer. And as Chriſt did in the laſt and great day of the feaſt: and <hi>Iſay</hi> in his propheſie: So doth God to all of us this day: <hi>Hoe, All you that thirſt, come to the waters, and care not for money, come, buy bread without money, and Wine and Milke without a price.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well then is God ſo libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that notwithſtanding we bee beggers, yet hee ſcorneth
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:20885:132"/> not our petitions: but giveth us firſt, and freely, fully, and abundantly: Is there nothing that thou canſt give him, or that he wil accept at thy ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds? Yes, three things, &amp; thoſe are,</p>
               <p>Firſt, thankes for what thou haſt received: For he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth this of thee, that thou ſhouldſt take the cup of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and give praiſe to his Name. That thou ſhouldſt call on him in the day of thy trouble, that hee may deliver thee, and thou maiſt glorifie him.</hi> And if thou doe not ſo, thou art but a beaſt, that drinkes of the ſtream, without remembrance of the ſpring.</p>
               <p>Secondly, come againe alſo and ſeeke more, for it is his delight. He is not like man, or the Sonne of man, who feareth to give, for feare of want, or wearieth to give, for frequency of petitions: No, his ſtorehouſe is not emptied.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:20885:133"/> 
                  <hi>The eyes of all things looke up to him, hee openeth his hand, and filleth them with his Bleſſing.</hi> Neither wearieth hee with our frequent petitions: but the homelyer we are, we are ſtill the welcomer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Remember alſo to give to the poore the thing that thou wouldeſt give him: For he that hath pitty on the poore, lendeth to the Lord: and hee that giveth to any of theſe a cup of cold water ſhall not want a rich reward.</p>

               <p>AFter the ſearch and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie of the word, <hi>bread,</hi> and of the word, <hi>give,</hi> which wee have explained to you in our two laſt ſermons: It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth now that wee take a view of the third word, <hi>Vs,</hi> That wee may truly know to whom, and to whoſe uſe it is that wee begge at the hands of God this bread.</p>
               <p>In handling of this petition the words are very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: whereas they are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall in their litterall ſenſe: ſo are they alſo, in their moral and ſpirituall uſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt is a word of
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:20885:134"/> demonſtration, and evidence: For it ſheweth us whereof wee ſtand in neede, that is, <hi>Bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is a word of faith, and ſheweth us upon whom wee ſhould depend for this <hi>Bread,</hi> and that is, <hi>Give.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third word, <hi>Vs,</hi> is a word of charity: begging <hi>Bread,</hi> and all neceſſary ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, not for our ſelves alone but alſo for the mutuall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the myſticall body of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The fourth word, <hi>Ours,</hi> is the word of a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>The fift word, <hi>Daily,</hi> is a word of contentment.</p>
               <p>And the laſt words, <hi>For this day,</hi> is a word of confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Wee have ſpoken of the word of demonſtration, and of the word of faith. Let us
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:20885:134"/> now looke to the word of charity, <hi>Vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I ſay is the Lecture of charity, and that I may cleere it, heare mee but a little.</p>
               <p>If any ſhall enquire, why I am commanded to ſay, <hi>give us,</hi> and not <hi>give mee,</hi> I anſwere, it is done for three cauſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the reference it hath with the Preface of this Prayer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the reference it hath with Gods providence and will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And for the reference wee ſhould have one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, as mutuall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the myſticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In the Preface and entry of this Prayer: When our Redeemer CHRIST JESVS leadeth us to God to powre
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:20885:135"/> out our wants before him, and to ſupplicate at his hands the ſupport of thoſe wants: hee will not ſuffer us to ſay, my Father, but, <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon is, none can tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call him, my father, but Chriſt Jeſus alone: Hee is his father, and his only by nature. he is ours, onely by adoption: and in him, and through him. It was hee, and he alone, who (being the image of the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible God, and the engraven forme, and character of his perſon) could onely and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely ſay unto him, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee:</hi> and ſay to us for our comfort, I goe to my Father, and to your Father; and to my God, and to your God: ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, that by nature wee are without hope, and without God in the world: but that in him, wee have a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:20885:135"/> with God, and are made partakers of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>And now as in the preface hee would not ſuffer us to go to God, unleſſe wee were firſt incorporate, and made mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his myſticall body: ſo here hee will not ſuffer us to begge any thing at his hands, whether temporall or ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: but that wherein we muſt repreſent the neceſſities of our brethren, as well as our owne: and ſupplicate their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe as well as our owne. In a word, as in the preface, hee taught us, how wee ſhould draw neere to God, &amp; begge a bleſſing with <hi>Iacob,</hi> under the garment of <hi>Eſau:</hi> So the uſe wee ſhould make thereof, ſhould be, a due remembrance of that Chriſtian communion, and fellowſhip wee have one with another in him: rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing with them that rejoyce,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:20885:136"/> and mourning with them that mourne: and remembring them that are in bonds, as if wee our ſelves were afflicted in the body.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I ſay, that we are taught ſo to ſay, to make us ſubmit our ſelves to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God.</p>
               <p>For there are many in the world, upon whom God hath beſtowed both riches and wealth in abundance: and they have no ſooner received the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but ſtraight they forget both God as the giver, and their brethren as fellow owners of their portion.</p>
               <p>And of this ſort of men it is that the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſpeaketh, whilſt hee repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Iſrael and Judah for ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing to their owne nets.</p>
               <p>To the end therefore, that man may know that hee hath nothing but what God giveth him: and that God giveth it
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:20885:136"/> to him to this end, that hee ſhould communicate to the neceſſities of them that want: hee will not ſuffer him to ſay, <hi>Give mee:</hi> but <hi>Give us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Would you ſee the truth of this cleared in a naturall, and domeſticke example. Looke upon the Mariner when hee goeth to ſea: his ſhip is fraugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſome owners: he is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened and her wares are full. The tide offereth occaſion, and ſhee is towed out to the road to wait upon the winde: ſhee lyeth there a good ſpace, and findes no winde. Would you know what maketh her want winde ſo long: I can tell you: becauſe ſhe prayeth for nothing, but for her faire winde. If her ſailes were fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, ſhee careth not whoſe be empty, nor whoſe voyage be croſſed.</p>
               <p>But tell mee, O man, hath God in his ever-ruling provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:20885:137"/> nothing to doe, but to ſerve thee, and thy appetite alone. No, no, hee hath more to ſerve then thee: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his infinite wiſdome, he ſometimes ſendeth thee a faire and proſperous gale of winde: ſometimes againe hee maketh the winde to blow contrary, that thou mayeſt learne in the ſenſe of thy owne weakneſſe, to reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent on his providence, and with a contempt and diſdaine of thy owne ſelfe-love, to rejoyce as much at the good of thy brother, as if it were thy owne; and to greeve as much at his loſſe as if the loſſe redounded to thee, equally with him.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, in this direction wee have a ſquare rule, limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to us the uſe of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: which is this: as in the begging of it wee ſhould bee faithfull, ſo in the managing
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:20885:137"/> thereof wee ſhould bee chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
               <p>It was the errour of <hi>Naball</hi> to poſſeſſe a well covered ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to himſelfe, but to forget <hi>David,</hi> and his diſtreſſe,</p>
               <p>It was alſo the errour of the rich man in the Goſpell, to crye peace to himſelfe: and to the rich glutton, to forget the neceſſities of <hi>Lazarus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But were theſe things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, and approved of God?</p>
               <p>No, nothing leſſe, for wee are all members of one body: and wee ſhould communicate one to anothers neceſſities, and that in love.</p>
               <p>I ſay, firſt we are all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one body: for where have you ſeene at any time the members of one body for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull, or ſenſeleſſe of the indigence of another: if a thorn do but pricke us in the toe, all the body hath a ſympathy,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:20885:138"/> and fellow feeling with it: the tongue can complaine, the eye can ſearch for it, and the hand can pluck it out againe.</p>
               <p>It is right ſo with us, in our ſpirituall incorporation. Wee are all parts of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall body, whereof Chriſt is the glorions head.</p>
               <p>Is it ſeeming then, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one part ſhall ſuffer, and the other ſhall have no ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy or fellow-feeling?</p>
               <p>No ſurely: for it is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident teſtimony, that wee are not of the body, unleſſe we have that fellow ſenſe that is here required.</p>
               <p>Looke to the example of the politicall body, and to the example of the waters running through the whole veines, and chanels of the earth: And learne with <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> to ſay, that God, <hi>Per eum qui habet juvat egentem, per
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:20885:138"/> eum qui non habet, probat haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, what is more, thou muſt not onely give him for the reliefe of his neceſſities, but alſo thou muſt give him a love and ſincerity of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for if thou ſhould give all that thou haſt to the poore, unleſſe thou have love, it is all abomination in the preſence of God, for our wealth of it ſelfe, it is not a bleſſing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe charity animate, quicken, and give it motion.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</label> Now out of al this which hath beene ſaid, there ariſeth to our inſtruction two things remarkable, the firſt rebukes the miſer; the ſecond rebukes the proud: I ſay firſt, we have here a leſſon of rebuke to the miſer, the worldly worme, &amp; the earthly wretch, and that for 3 cauſes; firſt for that hee is a murtherer: ſecondly, for that he is a perverter of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:20885:139"/> of God: and thirdly, for that hee is a foole.</p>
               <p>I ſay, firſt he is condemned here as a murtherer: for while God hath ordained meat for the belly, and the belly for meat, hee ſtarves in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery: and for a miſerable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of an handfull of duſt; hee kills his body, which ſhould have an habitation to the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>I ſay, ſecondly, that the miſer, and the wretch is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter of Gods ordinance, for God hath ſaid, <hi>In the ſweat of thy browes thou ſhalt eate thy bread:</hi> now the miſer can toile and turmoile himſelf in ſweat, and in blood ſometimes, to get a peece of bread, but when hee hath gotten it, hee cannot for the heart of him make uſe of it, nor take of it to ſerve his owne neceſſities,</p>
               <p>I ſay, thirdly, he is rebuke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as a foole, and why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:20885:139"/> out of a diffident care of his body hee killeth his ſoule; for whilſt hee diſtruſteth the providence of God towards him manifeſted in the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of <hi>Sarepthas</hi> barrels, hee hoardeth up treaſures againſt the laſt day, which in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of time ſhall eate up his fleſh, as it were a fire.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it rebukes the proud: for if God but once diſtinguiſh us one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with never ſo meane a portion of eſtate, it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee how farre, hee that hath, diſpiſeth him that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth; as if either wee had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured that of our ſelves, which wee have, or that they were not of our mould that want.</p>
               <p>But foole, why ſhould thou bee ſo miſcarried? All the power that thou haſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a white haire of thy head, blacke, nor a graine
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:20885:140"/> of ſeed that thou caſteſt in the ground to grow up againe, nor thy clothes to keepe thee warme, or thy meat to feed thee, except God adde a ſtaſſe to thy bread. Why ſhouldeſt thou bee proud then, or why ſhouldeſt thou misknow thy neighbour? knoweſt thou not that a ſhort time can make thee equall with the pooreſt beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that goeth abroad? <hi>Iob</hi> in one day was rich in poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ere Even he had not one to piſſe againſt the wall; the Sunne at his riſing ſaw him rich in Aſſes, Oxen, and Sheepe, ere night he had none of them.</p>
               <p>In the morning hee was ſtrong and vigorous, in his health; ere night, hee ſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his ſores with a pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard.</p>
               <p>In the morning hee had a wife to lye in his boſome,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:20885:140"/> ere the noone-tide in the day, ſhee is turned to a rocke of offence <hi>(Curſe God and dye.)</hi> God bee mercifull to us, how uncertaine, and tranſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are the things of this life.</p>
               <p>Why ſhould wee either bee proud, and overjoy in them: or niggards, or ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of them, not lending to the neceſſities of the poore?</p>
               <p>The Lord teach us humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and commiſeration, that our ſoules may be ſafe in the day of our Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Now in the fourth place wee have ſet downe to us a word of conſcience, whilſt wee call it, <hi>Our bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For in ſo doing wee crave of God, that hee would ſo accompany our travels with his bleſſing that wee walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and travelling in our calling for our neceſſities,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:20885:141"/> may have rather to be helpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto others, then burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to any.</p>
               <p>But here there would a doubt ſeeme to ariſe, wee have confeſſed already that we are indigent, and have no power of our ſelves to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure any reliefe of our neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, unleſſe it bee given us from above, how is it then ſince wee have nothing but what wee receive of God, that we ſhould be bold to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce and call it <hi>Our?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, it is no vaine rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to call that which God giveth us, <hi>Ours:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the bleſſings of God communicated to us are ours in three reſpects, firſt, as they are given to us in Chriſt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as they are acquired by us in our lawfull calling. Thirdly, as they are ſanctified to our uſe by the Word and Prayer. I ſay firſt they are
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:20885:141"/> Ours, as wee are in Chriſt; for if wee bee living and true members of the myſticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus Chriſt, then all the things in the world are ours, for it is written, <hi>All things are ours whilſt wee are Chriſts, for Chriſt is Gods,</hi> Get once a gripe of Chriſt by faith, and thou may boldly call the world, and all that is in it thine. It is true indeed, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men in the world have a better gripe of the world then the Chriſtian. Looke to the Apoſtles: Yet none had ſo good a right to it, for though they wanted the uſe, yet they had the onely title; And though they poſſeſſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yet had they true title to all things.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the creatures of God are ours, and we acquire them in our lawfull calling, not robbing, not ſpoiling, nor deceitfully, or trecherouſly
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:20885:142"/> living on the ſweat of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans brow, and eating the bread of violence. <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. Thinkeſt thou, O man, or woman, that there is no more required of thee, but that thou ſhouldeſt riſe in the morning, and having waſhed thy hands, ſit downe to thy dinner, and from thy dinner, to thy ſupper; and from thy ſupper to thy bed: No, no, this life is too eaſie to bee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt: Thou muſt eate thy bread in the ſweat of thy brow. Art thou a Magiſtrate, goe to the bench, exerciſe there juſtice and judgment: defend the innocent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the widdow, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe. Art thou a Mariner, get thee to the helme, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell through the deepe: Art thou a Miniſter, get thee to thy booke, reade, meditate, and pray: and look to whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever calling God hath called
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:20885:142"/> thee to, that therein thou bee exerciſed, or elſe, cover thy table, as well as ever the rich glutto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did: It ſhal be turned to a ſnare, and thy prayer to ſin, except thou can ſay, that this bread is my bread, being won in a lawfull calling, and procured by the ſweat of my brow.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it cannot be called thine, except thou haſt ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied it by the word and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The children of Iſrael had a table prepared for them in the wilderneſſe, but for want of this grace of ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, it turned to their ruine: for whilſt the meat was in their mouth, it came out at their noſtrels, and they peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the wilderneſſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fat bodies, and leane ſoules. It was not ſo in the dayes of our ſaviour Chriſt Jeſus in the dayes of his fleſh: hee had five thouſand people
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:20885:143"/> to feed with five loaves, and two fiſhes: but hee lifting up his eyes to his father, did not onely procure ſatisfaction to the eater, but alſo ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
               <p>Thus then the creatures of God are juſtly called ours, when wee get any right to them in Jeſus Chriſt. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when wee eate them in the ſweat of our brow. And thirdly, when they are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to our uſe, by the word, and by prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</label> Hence wee have theſe leſſons to learne: firſt, Labour, O man, to be ingrafted in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, for all things in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth are his, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting themſelves to him, acknowledge him their one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lord. It is hee by whom the Sunne giveth his radiation &amp; light. It is hee that covers the earth with fertility, and plenty. It is he that commands
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:20885:143"/> the windes and they blow, he ſpeakes to them peace againe, and they are huſhed and ſtill.</p>
               <p>It is hee, laſtly, who ſayeth to raging waves of the ſea, here ſhall ye come, and go no further, and behold they obey him with feare.</p>
               <p>Since reines of all things are in his hands, and the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation thereof in his power, labour thou to get a gripe of him by faith, and nothing ſhall be defective to thee; it may be that he can ſometimes out thee ſhort of theſe things that he gave thee, houſe, wife, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, proſperity or health; what matters it of all theſe, give him his will therein; and let it bee ſeene to the world, that thou art in him, by thy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, &amp; I will promiſe thee, in the name of the living God, Hee ſhall either reſtore thy captivity ſeaven fold, or elſe hee will give thee ſomething
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:20885:144"/> better then all the world, even himſelfe.</p>
               <p>It is a pitty to ſee ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as the men of the world are to get the things of this world, and ſo careleſſe as they are to get him without whom they can never have true title<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor right to the world, or to any thing in it: Can a houſe ſtand without the foundation? can a tree grow without the root? or can the body live, that is cut off from the head? no ſurely. Now if it bee ſo in nature, &amp; in theſe naturall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, how much more muſt it bee in the ſpirituall? Hee is our head, our husband, our foundation, our root; having him wee have all things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him wee have nothing. For as there is no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them that are in Jeſus Chriſt: ſo there is neither hope of grace in this, nor glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the life to come, to any
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:20885:144"/> that are not incorporated into him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as no man can call the creatures of God his, except hee who is in Chriſt Jeſus: ſo in the ſecond place, none can call the things of this life his, except hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them in a lawfull calling; and this ſhould teach the ſons of men, to take heed how they acquire their goods. One wanteth, and lyeth by the way, and robbeth the poore. Another wanteth, and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it of the devill by an ill meane, like <hi>Saul.</hi> A third wanteth, and with words of deceit hee ſtealeth into the houſe of the widdow, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe, and devoureth them, under pretence of protectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, like <hi>Abſolon.</hi> A fourth want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and becauſe hee is aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to begge, hee muſt bee a ſparke of contention: and like a Salamander live on that fire
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:20885:145"/> of diviſion. But enquire of theſe men, I pray you, if they eate their owne bread: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, their throats are wide, and their ſtomacks ample: but to ſay, they eate their owne bread I dare not; for their conſcience teacheth them, that they grinde the faces of the poore, and eate up the people, as if they were bread.</p>
               <p>And for this cauſe it is, that judgement commeth upon the land, becauſe ſuch men are not taken heed unto. If the belly god, if the wizards, and conſulter with ſathan, if the Salamander, and contentious man, ſhould be forced to eate their owne bread, then peace ſhould bee within our walls, and proſperity within our palaces. But becauſe theſe, and ſuch as theſe are tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, therefore it is that this land ſhall tremble, and every one mourne that dwelleth
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:20885:145"/> therein. Sackcloth ſhall be on all loynes, and baldneſſe on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very head, and the end of our viſitation ſhall be a bitter day. One thing onely reſteth, That we may eate our owne bread, wee muſt be carefull to have the ſame ſanctified to our uſe, by the meanes of the word of God, and of prayer; And this ſerveth wonderfully to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke the beaſtly ingratitude of men &amp; women in this time: For in ſtead of begging a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, when wee ſit downe, or being thankfull when we riſe, wee ſwallow up the bleſſings of God in forgetfulneſſe: Yea wee ſit downe to eate and to drinke and riſe up to play; and turne the grace of God to wantonneſſe: like beaſts drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the ſtreame without remembrance of the fountain. Neither is this the private and domeſticke errour of this land; no this is that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:20885:146"/> canker and gangren that hath fully and fowly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the face of this nation.</p>
               <p>Let us lift up our eyes, and behold the regions about us: where is there peace or plenty to Church or Commonwealth, but amongſt us? Enquire of the higher or lower Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: enquire of Cilicia: en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> of France, and of Spaine it ſelfe. All of them have beene ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as a reed in the water; fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, the ſword and the plague have deſtroyed their inheritance, depopulated their riches, overturned their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and laid their ſtrength on heapes in the ſtreetes, onely wee have beene left as a ſigne, and wonder to the world, both of peace and plenty: for our table hath beene prepared in the ſight of our enemies, and our cup hath runne over: but have wee beene thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full?
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:20885:146"/> no ſurely, wee have neither rightly acknowledged the day of our viſitation, nor wiſely conſidered the things that concerne our peace, but rather have continued in ſinne, that grace may abound, Well, this Halcion time will not alwayes reſt; remember Tirus and Sidon, Chorazin and Bethſada: and by them learne in time to redeeme the time, elſe out of time we ſhall ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row deſperately, becauſe wee would not ſorrow ſooner.</p>

So that the true and native ſignification and ſenſe
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:20885:149"/> of this petition is this, Lord give us the ſupplement of our neceſſities both for matter and for manner; For matter our bodies are earthly, and drawing neere to the earth ſtand in need of daily ſupport, ſupport us therefore daily with <hi>Bread.</hi> And for manner; becauſe little will content na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſuppoſe our deſires bee extravagant, give us that which may refreſh nature and maintaine this our natural life.

But I would enquire of them to what uſe this obſolete and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure word ſhould be uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. Are not the words of greateſt familiarity, of greateſt force alſo? Yes ſurely: For God who had ſundry times and in divers manners, made himſelfe knowne unto the world of old by his Prophets and Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes, under types, ſhadowes, figures, and tropes, he hath now in the end of time made himſelfe manifeſt to the world in Jeſus Chriſt his Son, who was the image of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible God, and the ingraven forme and character of his
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:20885:150"/> perſon, and that in ſuch a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and purity of revelation, that none can bee excuſed by reaſon of ignorance, for, <hi>If our Goſpell bee hidde it is hidde to them that periſh, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the eyes of their mindes.</hi> So, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then even there where people ſate in <hi>darkneſſe and in the ſhadow of death, if God have made a true light to our eyes, why ſhould they bee termes of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity and phraſes</hi> of darkneſſe to obſcure and eclipſe the light and ſun-ſhine of Gods truth, by keeping up from the people the word of God, and giving them the ſervice of God in a ſtrange tongue. I know, wherefore this can ſerve, but for one or two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, either that they may ſhew themſelves heires to the Scribes and Phariſees, whoſe chaires they claime: For they locked up the key of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:20885:150"/> they neither entered into the Kingdome of God themſelves, neither would they ſuffer others to enter: Even ſuch are the followers of the Church of Rome at this day; they ſit, as they alledge, in the chaire of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> but with any of <hi>Moſes</hi> traditions or of <hi>Peter</hi> his ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, they will not trouble ſo much as their little finger, and fearing leaſt any ſhould enter into the Kingdome of God, to their greater crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation too, like blinde guides they keepe their people in blindneſſe, and by the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of words ſo eclipſe and obſcure the truth, that una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares Millions of ſoules are by them ledde captive unto diſtruction.</p>

                  <label>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</label> Neither doe they in this alone expreſſe themſelves to build the ſepulchers of their fathers the Scribes and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:20885:151"/> Phariſees; But what is more, they really doe expreſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be the ſonnes of their Father the divell, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſuredly that nothing in the world can bee ſo forcible to extract a bleſſing from the hands of God, as Prayer: Nor any thing ſo ſtrong and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull to binde up the hands of God from correcting and judging us, as is the frequent and familiar confabulation and Prayers of his Saints: Hee therefore labours to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw men altogether from prayer, or elſe if he cannot get their mouthes ſtopped but that they muſt pray, then hee will have them praying in an unknowne tongue, that their table may be turned to a ſnare, and their prayers to ſinne. It is a wonder to ſee what folly is amongſt them, they will not go out of doores, without a croſſe about their neckes, as
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:20885:151"/> if it were an Antidote againſt whatſoever danger either ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall or temporall: And yet there is none ſheweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a greater enemy of the Croſſe of Chriſt; For how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever in word they confeſſe him, yet in their idolatrous practiſe they deny him; and having a name that they are living, in effect they are dead. Yet this is not all, ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verruling power and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty hath the Prince of darkneſſe got on them, that when their conſcience is opened to ſee their ſin, and their affections lead them to God, to deprecate the remiſſion of their ſinne, hee tongue-tyeth them that they cannot ſpeake to God: And if they ſpeak at all, it is but a rapſody of idle words, numbred out upon their Beades, as if God deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in much babling,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:20885:152"/> or Sathan could bee conjured with tale and number only of <hi>Pater noſters.</hi> But foole, that thou maiſt know, that God is a Spirit, and will bee worſhipped in ſpirit and truth: If thy ſervice be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and ſincere though weake, yet it is welcome; <hi>For the bruiſed reed hee will not breake, and the ſmoaking flaxe bee will not quench:</hi> But if thou dally with him in a Tautalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of unknowne words, all is in vaine; becauſe hee will caſt backe the duſt of thy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in thy face for praying to him with thy tongue, when thy underſtanding is without fruit.</p>
               <p>Againe, as it ſerveth for rebuke of the Church of Rome, ſo it ſerveth alſo for inſtruction to us of the true and pure Church; and that in theſe three reſpects;</p>
               <p>Firſt, in the matter of our
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:20885:152"/> true underſtanding.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the matter of our true content.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, in the matter of our true deſire.</p>
               <p>I ſay, firſt, that in this word, we have a leſſon given us to enforme our underſtanding: For whilſt wee goe to God and ſeeke of him <hi>Daily Bread,</hi> wee cannot but inſtruct our ſelves in the ſenſe of our daily want. Who is hee that hath a houſe and a daily raine drop in it, but will goe to the Slater and make him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire it? Who is hee which hath a ſhip which is leaking, but will goe to the carpenter and have it repaired both with timber and calfatting, Or hee that hath a wounded body, who will not goe to the Phyſitian and daily dreſſe his wound, and binde it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, till it bee cured? It is even ſo with us in the matter
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:20885:153"/> of our ſpirituall wants. Wee dwell here in Tabernacles and houſes of clay: This day there is a droppe in the roofe, to morrow a balke of our timber is cracked, and the third day there is a crevis in the wall. To whom ſhall wee goe but to the Maſter of the worke? and that daily, that by our daily neceſſities, wee may daily have our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to him, and in our dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approaches confeſſe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his daily provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Wee are alſo Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and wee are wounded men: Who ſhall make our ſhippe teight? Who can cure our wounds, but hee who is the ſpirituall carpenter and Phyſitian of our Soules? In all our diſtreſſes let us have our recourſe to him; For hee will not weary in doing us good, if we can come to him without wearying; For in
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:20885:153"/> due time, wee ſhall receive our reward, if wee faint not.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in this word wee are taught how to bridle our affections: for the deſires of men are infinite, and have no end: they are like the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leech, that ſaith alwayes, Give, give, and like the grave that is never ſatisfied. Yet behold, O man, it were good for thee, to ſet bounds to thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, for God in his wiſdome hath put in this Petition a word of content, <hi>daily:</hi> That as the globe of the earth is girded about with the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian line, ſo theſe earthly hearts of ours may be girded about, and kept in frame with the compaſſe of content. It is with us in this laſt age, as with Iſrael in the wilderneſſe: for when they gathered their Manna, God commanded that they ſhould gather but an Omer, and either under or
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:20885:154"/> above, according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their family. It is even ſo with us, God will not give us a liberty to ſeeke the things of this earth, but with mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and mediocrity, ſo much as may refreſh, and maintaine nature with a reaſonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. But though this bee the ordinance of God, O how exorbitant are the deſires of men? how waſtfull is our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in meate, drinke and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, &amp; purchaſing of lands? I ſay, wee are waſtfull in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of our meate, drinke, and apparell: for there is more on one of our tables at one time, then would ſatisfie all the poore of the city, if it were well parted. We drinke at once more cups of health, then <hi>Bacchus</hi> did in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyes. And one ſuit of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell on our backe is bought at a dearer rate, then all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of many of our heires
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:20885:154"/> can amount to. Looke againe upon our purchaſing: God commandeth us to ſeeke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but our daily bread, but behold, wee joyne houſe to houſe, land to land, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance to inheritance: and when wee have done all that wee can to make it large and ample, if there bee but one foote bredth of ground under our window, or within the ſmoake of our chimney, that is not ours, O how ſicke are we of diſcontent with <hi>Achab,</hi> till <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to our incloſures. And yet if wee would conſider how ſoone wee may be taken from it; how deboiſt an heire wee ſhall leave it to: or how little ground will content, and conteine us when wee dye: I hope wee ſhould not bee ſo earth hungry. But all our er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is in this, wee forget the word of Gods ordinance;
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:20885:155"/> 
                  <hi>daily.</hi> And wee dreame of a word of eternity, <hi>Evermore:</hi> So the folly of the one over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowes the truth of the other in us; and wee become forgetfull of the word of God: If thou get food and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thou ſhould bee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with content.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it ſhould captivate our will to the entertainment of a daily familiarity with God: for this is ſure, we have nothing, but what God giveth us daily, why ſhould wee not then run to him daily, &amp; hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſeeke it? Brethren, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not looke without pitty upon the eſtate of the weake Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in this point: for in it hee is inferiour to the pooreſt beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that goeth in the ſtreete; the begger, becauſe he knows that he hath nothing but what good people gives him, hee goeth into the open wayes where people have greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:20885:155"/> and becauſe his neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are daily, and quotidian, therefore hee is not aſhamed to bee a daily and quotidian begger, but in this wee come ſhort of him, for we are all as indigent of grace as hee of meanes, and yet hee can begge daily, wee cannot: hee can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take himſelfe into the place of ſupport: but wee will not: the place of our ſupport is the Church: the ſtrength of our begging lyeth in prayer. The begger wearyeth not to goe into the high wayes; we wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to come to the Church: he wearyeth not to ſupplicate with all the termes of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hee can invent; wee weary ere wee can breath two or three words, though but for faſhion. But heare, O my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, theſe things ſhould not be ſo; for as our neceſſities are ſo much the more urgent, by how much they are ſpirituall:
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:20885:156"/> ſo ſhould our prayers be, both the more frequent and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, by how much the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven is not obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned but by violence, and if at any time our petitions be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to us without ſucceſſe, it is becauſe they want heart. I have many times told from this place, that, that which <hi>Martha</hi> ſaid to Chriſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Lazarus,</hi> may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid to our ſoules, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning prayer, and the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof; ſhee ſaid, <hi>Lord, if thou hadſt beene here my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lazarus had not dyed:</hi> ſo thou and I, and all of us may ſay, If prayer had beene here, this ill turne had not falne in our hands: for prayer is not the worke of fleſh and blood, but of the Holy Ghoſt; where it is, hee is; and where hee is guide, wee cannot ſo ſtumble, but of neceſſity wee muſt riſe againe. So much I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:20885:156"/> concerning the word <hi>dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> which I called a word of content: there reſts now in all this Petition but a word, <hi>This day:</hi> This I called a word of limitation: and by it I meane to limit and put an end to this Sermon.</p>
               <p>By the word then of, <hi>This day,</hi> I underſtand this preſent moment of time, in which we live, called by <hi>David</hi> a yeare: <hi>The yeares of men are but three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and ten. Iob</hi> calleth it a moneth, <hi>I have had for my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance but the moneths of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:</hi> and here it is called a day, becauſe as yeſterday is gone, and is no more, ſo wee ſhall bee to morrow. Wee have nothing in time, or of time, which wee can truly call ours, but <hi>this day;</hi> and in it, but this moment: God then in his wiſdome, hath not onely ſet bounds to the quality of our deſires, calling them but <hi>daily,</hi>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:20885:157"/> but alſo limiteth the time and continuance of them to this day: but if any worldling ſhall grudge at his leaſe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too ſhort, let him know that the words are not mine, but Gods. For whatſoever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments of grace, hee hath given to the ſonne of man, hee hath given it under the title and precinct of <hi>this day,</hi> he ſaid to the Sonne of man, (his own Sonne, the Lord Chriſt Jeſus) in his inſtalment: <hi>Thou art my beloved Son, this day have 'I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten thee. Pſal.</hi> 2. Hee ſaid to his people Iſrael, (his ſons by adoption) <hi>The Lord hath choſen thee this day to bee a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people unto him. Deut.</hi> 26. Hee ſaid to his ſervant the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> in the time of his calling: <hi>This day have I ſet thee up over Kingdomes, &amp; over nations: Iſay</hi> 1.10. Laſtly, hee ſaid to the theefe on the Croſſe: <hi>This day thou ſhalt bee
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:20885:157"/> with mee in paradiſe.</hi> Neither is this the onely and ſole title, and precinct of his endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but alſo the title and ſole reciprocation hee craves of us, and that both in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his obedience, and of our content and deſires.</p>
               <p>In the matter of our obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, hee will have it to <hi>day:</hi> To day if you will heare his voice, harden not your hearts. And of our deſires: <hi>Give us this day our daily bread,</hi> and reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good it is that it ſhould ſpeake ſo; for by ſo ſaying, firſt, hee pares the covetous mans nailes. Secondly, hee bindeth up the prodigalls hands, and cutteth downe the Epicures vaine hope. I ſay, Firſt, by this word hee pares the covetous mans nailes, for hee will pare them himſelfe, hee lets them grow that hee may ſcrape, and ſcratch, and gather together, without
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:20885:158"/> ſatisfaction of deſire, without wearying in travell. He riſeth early in the morning, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth late to bed at night, and all the day long eates the bread of ſorrow: as if his belly was like his heart tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular, and uncapable of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction: but foole that he is, what is this he doth? know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hee not, that wee are but here to day, and away to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: for <hi>All fleſh is graſſe, Care not therefore for the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but let the morrow care for it ſelfe: for this day hath enough of its owne griefe. Et magno apparatu breve iter vitae non in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruitur, ſed oneratur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, God by this word bindes up the prodigals hands, for it is the deſire of many men in the world to have God giving them, not one peece this day, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther peece to morrow, as we ſtand in need of it; but wee
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:20885:158"/> will have al our portion toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the prodigall child ſaid, Father, give mee my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that befalls mee: and when hee got it, you know what became of it. God therefore being wiſer then wee, will not caſt all our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony in our lap together, but like a wiſe father, will give us our eſtate, but peece &amp; peece, and will ſee how we imploy the little hee lendeth us, that hee may make us Lords over much, and wee may every day honour him in the ſuit and requeſt of his ſupply.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, hee cutteth the vaine hope of the Epicure, who like an atheiſt makes covenant with death, and an agreement with hell: and ſaith with the whore in the <hi>Revelation, I am a Queene, and ſhall ſee no mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi> To this man God cries here as hee cryed to the rich
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:20885:159"/> man in the Goſpell, ſaying, <hi>Foole, this night they ſhall take thy ſoule from thee:</hi> ſo here hee cryes to the Epicure; This day thou ſhalt dye, and ſhalt not ſee the morrow: by one dayes diſeaſe I will beat that ſoule of thine out of her citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell. <hi>Watch therefore, and pray, for yee know not at what houre the theefe will come.</hi> One day is too long to dwell in the tents of <hi>Kedar,</hi> but in the preſence of the Auncient of dayes, there is fulneſſe of joy, and at his right hand, there are pleaſures for evermore.</p>

               <p>IN handling of this Petition wee have two things to conſider, the coherence or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of this Petition with the former: and next the tenour and force of the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelfe</p>
               <p>The coherence is evident, in the conjunctive particle <hi>and.</hi> For whilſt in the laſt petition, Our Redeemer Chriſt Jeſus teacheth us to begge of him things meete for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of this our naturall life, hee packed up the Petition in ſome few words of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: ſo here, knowing that man is too much addicted to ſet his heart, and fixe his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon the earth, and the things thereof, in a ſnatch as it were, hee recals us againe
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:20885:160"/> to the conſideration of the ſoule, and teacheth us to hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and thirſt for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the life, and well being of the ſoule. For what ſhall it availe a man if hee winne the whole world, and loſe his owne ſoule?</p>
               <p>In a word, by the conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and tying of this petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the former, I can reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our Saviour to nothing better, then to a wiſe and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Pylot, who ſeeing his company ſicke, and weary with continuall ſtormes at ſea, when he knoweth hee is neere any land, letteth his ſick, and faint hearted company go on ſhore to refreſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to get the aire of the land, to take in new victuals and proviſion, to ſerve the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of their ſucceeding voyage: but if hee finde them to begin to be enamored with love of the land, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:20885:160"/> thereof, ſtraight wayes hee ſendeth a boat on ſhoare, &amp; reclaimes them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet of their pleaſures, telling them, that if any amongſt them would bee at home, at his owne Countrie, hee muſt come aboard againe; for it is not the dallying with the pleaſures of a ſtrange country, that will bring him home to his owne ſoyle. It is even ſo with our Saviour in theſe words: for in the firſt three Petitions wee were ſet to ſea, and commanded to ſaile home to heaven: for whilſt man ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours Gods name, advanceth Gods kingdome, and doth Gods will, what is hee doing but ſailing through a ſtormy ſea, to a good harbour, and a quiet haven of reſt? now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, while men have lanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to the ſea of the world, and are ſailing homeward, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny croſſe windes and boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:20885:161"/> ſtormes hinder them by the way: Chriſt like a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete and mercifull pylot, and maſter of our ſhip, in the laſt Petition giveth us this day our daily bread, ſets us on ſhoare, and lets us play a while in the free aire, and refreſheth us with the pleaſures of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, giving us leave to ſatiate and ſatisfie our ſelves with ſuch proviſion, as the neceſſity of this our naturall life requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at our hands: but knowing very well the nature of man, that when hee getteth leave to play with the world, hee will take a large inch to the ell: and that in ſtead of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his neceſſitie, hee will inebriate, and ſurfet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: therefore in this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>And forgive us our treſpaſſes,</hi> hee ſhootes a boat after them, and calls them to come home, and to come aboard againe, for
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:20885:161"/> feare, that by playing too long with the world, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the ſhoore, they loſe the opportunity of their voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age homeward: for as the wiſdome of the world is foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe with God, ſo the love of the world is enmity with God: and whoſoever is a friend of the worlds, is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie of God. <hi>Iames</hi> 4. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. And this I take to bee the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the coherence of this Petition to the former.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</label> Let us now looke upon this tye and particle of conjunction, that wee may learne ſomething from it.</p>
               <p>The uſes, and obſervations which ariſe here-from are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it teacheth how to uſe the things of this world. Man, ſince the fall of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> hath brought nothing into the world with him, but an uncircumciſed heart, and a
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:20885:162"/> body of ſinne dwelling in his fleſh, and from thence as from a bitter roote of corruption floweth nothing in all his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, but fearfull and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious tranſgreſſions, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the which this is one, and the chiefe, that his heart is become earthly and muddy: in the beginning hee had a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy earthly, and from the earth, but his ſoule was celeſtiall, and from above, not onely in reſpect of eſſence, but alſo in reſpect of the faculties, and the qualities of theſe faculties; now by his fall his ſoule is made like his body, though not in eſſence, or faculties, for they are ſtill ſpirituall, yet in reſpect of the qualities of theſe faculties: for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the naturall man knoweth nothing, but the things of the earth: his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions delight in nothing, but that which is earthly: and his
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:20885:162"/> will practiſeth nothing but that which is of the earth, and in the earth: but theſe things ought not to bee ſo; wee are come from home, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning thither againe. Doth it become a pilgrim whilſt he is in the way, to be overtaken with the pleaſures of the way? no certainly: for if hee bee in love with the pleaſures of the way, hee ſhall never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to his journeyes end. Do you not remember what is written in prophane ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries concerning <hi>Theſeus,</hi> and <hi>Atalanta,</hi> a woman of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſwiftneſſe, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overtaken with the love of the golden balls which <hi>Theſeus</hi> let fall by the way, loſt the race, and the reward of it? But why do I cite a prophane ſtory; looke to the word of God, and the truth therein contained, there you ſhall finde, <hi>Iudges</hi> 7. That the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:20885:163"/> Lord choſing out an army for <hi>Gedion</hi> to overthrow <hi>Midian:</hi> he firſt ſent away the fearfull and faint hearted, which were two and twenty thouſand: then hee ſent away thoſe who fell downe on their knees, and dranke water, which were nine thouſand, and ſeaven hundred: ſo that there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all the hoſt of <hi>Gedion,</hi> but three hundred to overthrow their enemies; and theſe were ſuch as ſtooped not downe to inebriate themſelves with the waters of the river, but ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at them onely, with their hand, refreſhing onely the tip of their tongues, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their journey. It ſhould bee ſo with us, in uſing the things of this life: wee ſhould uſe them as though wee uſed them not: hee that rejoyceth ſhould not bee over-joyed in his rejoycing, and hee that is in griefe ſhould not bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:20885:163"/> in his ſorrow. He that hath, ſhould not be proud: hee that wanteth ſhould not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpare; <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and moderation ſhould bee ſhowne, as men knowing that the faſhion of this world periſheth. Let us therefore bee like <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 28.20. And like Chriſts diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. <hi>Labour not for the meat that periſheth.</hi> And like Iſrael. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee have here a ſecond leſſon, which ſerveth for our inſtruction, and I pray you conſider it. Man if hee want, he murmures, he grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and repines. It was the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Iſrael in the want of water, to murmure againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the want of bread, and of fleſh: So that his heart was grieved. <hi>Rachel</hi> in the want of children could mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, and ſay to <hi>Iacob, Give mee children elſe I die.</hi> And <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> himſelfe in his barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:20885:164"/> could ſay to God, <hi>Elia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi> my ſervant ſhall bee my heire So hard and indured are the hearts of men, till God both make them ſee and feele the force of his care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence towards them: neither is the diſcontentment, and grudge of men cleare in the example of theſe Fathers, but alſo in our own daily and quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian practice: the poore man is no ſooner fallen from his eſtate, then through diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt of the providence of God, hee muſt ſteale; the ſick man is no ſooner in the bed of his diſeaſe, but hee ſends for a wiſard to ſee if hee can recover. The man that is wronged, hath no ſooner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his affront, or word of reproach, but ſtraight his ſword muſt bee his judge and decider of his quarrell: and his owne hand muſt cenſure that, which hee can neither
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:20885:164"/> digeſt, nor caſt up againe.</p>
               <p>But tell mee, O man, from whence proceeds this thy folly? wanteſt thou? is there not a God in heaven, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>The eyes of all things do looke up and truſt in thee, O Lord.</hi> Art thou ſicke? is there not a God in Iſrael, in whoſe hands are the iſſues of life and death? Art thou wronged? knoweſt thou not that vengeance is the Lords, and he will repay: For it is a righteous thing with the Lord, to render tribulation to them that trouble us, and peace unto us in the day of reſt. Why do wee then in the day of our trouble wrong both our ſelves, and our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings by our precipitations? Knoweſt thou from whence this thy precipitation flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? becauſe thou knoweſt not, I will tell thee. It floweth abſolutely, from the want of
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:20885:165"/> the ſight of thy ſinne. If thou knewſt wherefore thy goods were taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee, wouldſt thou murmure? No. If thou knewſt wherefore thy health was taken from thee, wouldſt thou grudge? No. if thou knew from whence thy wrong came, wouldſt thou repine? No. All the diſtemper co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth from this, thou knowſt not the cauſe of it. Thy ſinnes that are not forgiven thee, are the cauſe of all thy calamity. If thou hadſt but truly repented thee of thy ſinnes, and by faith gotten the aſſurance of thy pardon: I will aſſure thee thy captivity ſhould have bin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, &amp; thy righteouſneſſe ſhould have ſhined as the Sun at the noontide of the day but as long as thou haſt neither gotten thy ſins pardoned thee, nor haſt pardoned others their ſinnes againſt thee, it is no wonder, though thou ſay
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:20885:165"/> to God, Give mee this day my daily bread, and get it not, for it is ſure that the Lord heareth not, nor accepts of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, for as it is true, that the ſeede of the righteous man was never ſeene to beg his bread for want: ſo on the other part it is as true, The candle of the wicked ſhall be put out, and another man ſhall take his charge. The evidence hereof is cleare in Iſrael, in the dayes of the Judges. Looke to <hi>Sheba,</hi> and <hi>Ieſabel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly and laſtly, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buketh us for the dirty and muddy quality of our hearts, and inſtructeth us in the true cauſe and occaſion of our wants, ſo it teacheth us how to uſe the creatures aright, or rather how wee ſhould exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our ſelves aright after the uſe of the creatures; when man ſitteth downe to uſe the creatures of God, Three
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:20885:166"/> things are required of him: Premeditation, ſobriety, exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: Premeditation in acknowledging his unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe of them, for in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they are the good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God, as well as thou art, yea, in ſome reſpect they are better then thou: for though thou wert created to a more glorious image; yet by their innocency they have kept a more glorious ſtation, for thou haſt ſinned, and not they, and they ſubject to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, not becauſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but becauſe of him, who hath ſubdued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> under hope. Sit never downe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O man, to thy dinner without preponderatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou ſeeſt the creatures of God ſet before thee, know, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, they lived once, as thou liveſt now; and what reaſon had God, to bring them from afarre, and take
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:20885:166"/> their life from them, and to give thee liberty to uſe them: but his mercy, and not thy merit; his favour, not thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving? that the ſenſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may teach thee, that his grace is every way his grace, though thy ſin be out of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſinfull.</p>
               <p>Adde hereunto, that as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premeditation is requiſite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their uſe, ſo ſobriety in their uſe; for it becomes us not to ſit downe and glut with them, as if wee had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do but to fill our bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and ſatisfie our deſires: No, no, meat is ordained for the belly, and the belly for meat, but God will deſtroy them both. And he that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers but for the food that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth, may ſatisfie himſelfe for a while, but in the end hee ſhall both hunger and thirſt, and ſhall not bee ſatisfied at all. This was the advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:20885:167"/> that our Maſter Chriſt Jeſus gave to his Diſciples; Take not care for your belly what you ſhall eate, or for your back what you ſhall put on, for your heavenly Father knoweth whereof ye ſtand in need before you aske, and he will not ſuffer you to want the thing without the which you cannot ſerve him. Uſe then the things of this life ſoberly for thou haſt more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou broughteſt into the world with thee, thou haſt more then thou uſeſt well, and thou haſt more then thou canſt take out of the world. If thou get therefore food and raiment, learne therewith to be content.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, before thou riſe from the table examine thy ſelfe, and ſee wherein thou haſt made thy ſelfe unworthy of the ſucceeding uſe of his creatures, by the abuſe of
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:20885:167"/> thoſe which thou haſt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: For I will aſſure thee, when man is full, hee waxeth wanton: and the plenty of his table maketh him oftentimes fall into thoſe ſinnes, which the hungry heart falleth not into. Is was not in the time of <hi>Noahs</hi> ſobriety, that his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe was diſcovered, but in the time of his exceſſe. It was not in the time of <hi>Lots</hi> ſobriety, that hee fell into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt, but in his exceſſe. It was not in the time of <hi>Ammons</hi> faſting, that hee fell before <hi>Abſolon,</hi> but in the time of his feaſting. When God therefore hath filled our bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies with good things, let us not riſe without due exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our owne hearts, to ſee wherein wee have ſinned. Let us with <hi>Iob,</hi> ſacrifice eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning after our feſtivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: for it may bee that the fulneſſe of our cups hath made
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:20885:168"/> us blaſpheme our God: as it was with Iſrael, they ſate downe to eate and to drinke, and roſe up to play: and they felt the wrath of God upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in the fatnes of their bodies, &amp; in the leanneſſe of their ſoules</p>
               <p>Since therefore God hath coupled theſe things together, let no man put them aſunder, but let all fleſh in trembling examine himſelfe: and when hee hath ſaid, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread,</hi> let him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all adde, <hi>And forgive us our treſpaſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I feare I ſpend too much time in the deſcription of the dependance, and cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of this petition with the former, and of the uſes ariſing therefrom: It reſteth now that wee come to the Petition it ſelfe, In which, two things are remarkable; a ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a covenant or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which the ſupplication
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:20885:168"/> is ſealed; firſt, the ſupplication is, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes;</hi> the condition ſealing the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is, <hi>As wee forgive them that treſpaſſe againſt us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt return to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication it ſelfe, in which, five things do ſubordinately offer themſelves to our conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>
               <p>Firſt, what wee are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſinners, &amp; Gods debters.</p>
               <p>Secondly, what wee aske concerning our naturall eſtate in ſinne, and that is pardon, and forgiveneſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, from whom it is that wee aske this pardon: and it is neither from Angels in heaven, nor man on earth, but from God our Father in Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is in heaven, and who hath given us in his Sonne the hope of the ſame inheritance.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, wee have to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the intereſt wee have
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:20885:169"/> unto this ſinne, that wee crave to be pardoned, and it is <hi>Ours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly and laſtly, wee muſt conſider the extent of this our ſupplication, and it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not onely to our ſelves alone, but alſo to all our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and fellow-members of the myſticall body of Jeſus Chriſt: and therefore wee ſay not, Forgive mee, but, forgive us: and this I thinke is the true and lively anatomy, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the firſt part of the Petition: the other wee ſhall weigh and examine when we come to it.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing conſiderable here is our eſtate &amp; condition by nature, which is two waies expreſſed: firſt, in the eſſence thereof &amp; next in the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the one privatly couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the boſome of the other, the other publique, manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the death of mans miſery: the eſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his miſery is, that
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:20885:169"/> hee is a ſinner. The true title &amp; indigitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that his eſtate in ſin is, that it maketh him to be Gods debter. But to return: our eſtate by nature is not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially ſet downe here, but by way of denomination: for here <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, <hi>Forgive us our debts,</hi> while S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith in his 11. Chap. <hi>Forgive us our ſinnes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to returne to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this our naturall eſtate; it is here ſet downe two wayes: firſt, by denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and then by confeſſion. It is denominated a debt: it is confeſſed whilſt wee begge pardon for it.</p>
               <p>The denomination is a debt: many titles and names of ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification are given to ſinne in Scripture. Sometimes it is called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſometimes <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſometimes <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:20885:170"/> and here it is called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. All of theſe words impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant enough, to ſignifie and expreſſe the depth of that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, into the which man by ſinne hath fallen. Yet none doth more truly expreſſe his miſery then this, that by ſinne hee is become Gods debtor: but thou wilt ſay, O man, How comes it to paſſe, that by ſinne man is made Gods debter, ſeeing God neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth ſinne of man, nor is ſinne a debt due to God? But to anſwer this, I would have thee to know, that there are divers ſorts of debts which man oweth: there is a naturall debt which man oweth, there is a ſpirituall debt, and there is a civill debt which hee ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. The naturall debt is that which hee oweth to death, and ſhall pay it will hee nill hee: for wee came all of us into the world, but upon this
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:20885:170"/> condition, that wee ſhall goe out of it againe, for duſt wee are, and to duſt wee muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne: for it is appointed for all men once to dye, and after death judgement ſhall come. Our earth muſt returne to earth, and our ſpirit to God that gave it.</p>
               <p>Finally, this earthly houſe of our tabernacle muſt bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, &amp;c. And this is called the firſt death, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a ſeparation of the ſoule from the body for a time, till God reunite them both in glory. The Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all debt is that, which man oweth to the God of nature, and it is twofold, either the debt of obedience, or the debt of puniſhment. The debt of obedience is the debt of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.12. The debt of puniſhment is called the ſecond death, to the which man is bound for ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:20885:171"/> of the juſtice of God in caſe of not performing, and paying of the debt of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe. The debt of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe is truly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called debt. The debt of puniſhment is but figuratively and improperly ſo called: and that for two cauſes, firſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the antecedent: and next, in reſpect of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. In reſpect of the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, righteouſneſſe, which we ſhould have obeyed: and in reſpect of the conſequent, puniſhment, which is due to him that diſobeies, as it is written, <hi>Tribulation, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh ſhall bee, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There remaineth a third debt that man oweth, and it is mixed, for it is partly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, and partly civill. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, when according to the preſcript of the word of God, wee give reverence to whom wee owe reverence,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:20885:171"/> feare to whom we owe feare, and love to whom wee owe love: civill, when wee render to every man that which wee have borrowed, remembring that it is a bleſſing to owe nothing unto any man, and the curſe of the wicked, that he borroweth and payeth not againe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.</p>

               <p>IN the end of our laſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wee looked on the words of the Petition it ſelfe, wherein wee found foure things conſiderable.</p>
               <p>Firſt, what wee are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſinners, and debters to God, whereof wee have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in our laſt Sermon. Now it remaines, that wee go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:20885:172"/> to conſider the other three parts; and firſt of the pardon of our ſinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Forgive:</hi> In handling of which word I purpoſe not with <hi>Salmeron</hi> the Jeſuite to diſpute concerning the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the word, and to ſearch whether it had beene better to have ſaid, <hi>remitte,</hi> then as it is here, <hi>dimitte.</hi> I will onely according to the received &amp; approved cuſtome of the Church, ſpeake of the word, as it implyeth a pardon, &amp; free remiſſion of our ſins, which are our ſpirituall debts. For never did man ſpeake in ſo naturall a dialect as this is, for all the other conditions diſplayed the condition and temper of his faith: this the condition of his nature: theſe implyed the good he hoped for: this demonſtrates the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miſery, &amp; body of death, under which hee lyeth, ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:20885:172"/> and groaneth, deſiring to be eaſed: and to ſpeake truly, what can bee more acceptable unto God, then the confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinne, and the ſuit of pardon. Did not our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, in the dayes of his fleſh, call upon all them that were weary and ladened, to come to him, that hee might give them eaſe of their burthen, &amp; reſt to their ſoules? Whilſt therefore, hee ſhall ſee us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our burthen, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe our debt, ſhall we not be welcome to him? O know this, O man, for thy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, the ſheepheard never rejoyced more, in the recovery of his loſt ſheepe: nor the woman, of her loſt penny: nor the father, of his loſt ſonne, then God is well pleaſed, and glad of thy returne to him, ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give thee thy debt, if in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility thou canſt but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it, for it is written,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:20885:173"/> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed is the man that confeſſeth his ſinne, and forſakes it; but hee that hideth his tranſgreſſion ſhall not proſper.</hi> Well then, ſeeing wee have in the firſt word confeſſed our burthen, and debt, let us now come to the ſecond, and conſider our deſire of pardon, and releaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Forgive:</hi> Debts are releaſed and forgiven two manner of wayes; either freely, by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning the debtor; or elſe le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally, by exacting the debt, and ſo acquitting it.</p>
               <p>Againe, this legall releaſe, and acquitting of debt, is two wayes: firſt, when the debt is paid by the true debtor. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when it is ſatisfied, not by the true debter, but by him who became ſuerty for him: &amp; to this effect it is that <hi>Iuſtin.</hi> telleth us, <hi>Inſt. l.</hi> 3. <hi>tit.</hi> 30. <hi>Tollitur omnis obligatio ſolutione ejus quod debetur, non tamen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt quis ſolvat, utrum is qui
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:20885:173"/> debet, an vero alius pro eo.</hi> Now ſhall we looke on mans ſinne as it maketh him Gods debtor, and enquire how it is forgiven. I anſwer, O man, thy ſinne is forgiven thee, both ingenuouſly, and legally. Ingenuouſly, becauſe freely, and voluntarily. Legally, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thy debt is paid, though not by thy ſelfe, yet by thy ſuerty Jeſus Chriſt, who hath done all, ſuffered all, and paid all, that it be hooved thee to doe, to ſuffer, and to pay, for the ſatisfaction of the juſtice of God: hee did it for thee, and thou haſt done it in him. But that this may be the more cleare, and the termes of our pardon may bee the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly known, let us conſider the debt of ſinne, as it is ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally impoſed upon three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ſorts of perſons, to wit, the reprobate Angels, and men: on the elect amongſt the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:20885:174"/> ſonnes of men: and on the Sonne of God, for the loſt ſons of men.</p>
               <p>Now according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of the imputation of this debt, ſo is the releaſe and pardon thereof diverſly and ſeverally graunted: the reprobate Angels and Sonnes of men have the debt and burthen of ſinne imputed to them: but the pardon and releaſe of ſinne, neither doth nor ever ſhall appertaine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: for with them the Lord doth, and ſhall deale in the ſeverity of his juſtice for ever, for they ſhall bee caſt in priſon, where they cannot come out till they have paid the uttermoſt farthing: And becauſe they cannot pay, they ſhall not be forgiven.</p>
               <p>The elect ſonnes of men, who are choſen veſſels of mercy, and appertaine to the covenant of grace by vertue
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:20885:174"/> of their election, had the debt of their ſins imputed to them, when as they were borne dead in their ſinnes and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, and were ſtrangers by nature from the life of God, as well as the children of wrath; but now, bleſſed bee God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, the releaſe and pardon of our ſinnes: for that which was impoſſible to the law in ſo far as it was weak, becauſe of the fleſh; God ſending his owne Sonne in the ſimilitude of ſinfull man, and that for ſinne, condemned ſinne in the fleſh, that the righteouſneſſe of the law might bee fulfilled in us, who walke not after the law but after the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Sonne of God had the debt and burthen of of ſinne impoſed upon him; not of his owne ſinne, for hee that knew not ſinne was made ſinne for us. And with him
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:20885:175"/> God hath dealt with ſuch ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of his juſtice, that hee came from <hi>Boſra</hi> with red garments, hee hath trodden the wine-preſſe of the Father alone: and in the anguiſh, and bitterneſſe of his ſorrow, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee?</hi> If wee ſhall looke to the perſons to whom this releaſe and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſinne is promiſed, and promulgated, wee ſhall finde it, that it is onely to the elect veſſels of mercy, and to the children of Gods free love: whereas to the reprobate men and Angels, there is neither promiſe, nor hope of pardon left. For their judgement is ſealed, and their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſleepes not.</p>
               <p>Againe, as to Jeſus Chriſt the mediator of the new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, a free pardon hee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained not: he paid the utmoſt farthing, that was requiſite
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:20885:175"/> for the ſatisfaction of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God: onely to man, and the elect amongſt the ſonnes of men, hath God vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily and freely forgiven the burthen, and the debt of ſinne. And I call this a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and free forgiveneſſe, for three reſpects. In reſpect of God the Father: in reſpect of God the Sonne, and in reſpect of God the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>For I ſay, firſt, in reſpect of God the Father, for hee who ſaid, <hi>In the day that thou ſhalt eate, thou ſhalt ſurely die:</hi> ſaid alſo, <hi>the ſeed of the woman ſhall tread downe the head of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</hi> And againe, <hi>God ſo loved the world, that hee ſent his owne Sonne to the death of the Croſſe, that whoſoever beleeveth in him ſhould not periſh but have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</hi> It is free alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God the Sonne; for hee as willingly and freely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the great worke of
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:20885:176"/> mans redemption (howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the way was ſharpe, and thorny) as the Father was willing in his eternall wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to propoſe it. And therefore it is written of him, that he laid his life down, and tooke it up againe, hee laid it downe, for none could take it from him, and hee tooke it up againe, for it was impoſſible, that hee could bee holden of the ſorrows of the grave.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the pardon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of our ſinnes, is free in reſpect of God the Holy Ghoſt: for willingly and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without any merit on our part, he commeth downe, and dwelleth in our ſoules, illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates our underſtanding, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth our will ſanctifieth our affections, makes interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for us, with ſighs, and groanes that cannot be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and keepes us by the power of his grace through
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:20885:176"/> faith to eternall ſalvation; for it is written, <hi>Becauſe wee are ſonnes, God hath ſent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we cry Abba, Father.</hi> And againe, becauſe wee of our ſelves know neither how to pray, nor what to pray, the ſpirit helpeth our infirmities, and maketh interceſſion for us with ſighs that cannot bee expreſſed. And alſo it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; <hi>That as hee hath begotten us to a lively hope by the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Ieſus Chriſt from the death, to an inheritance which is immortall and undefiled, that withers not away: but is reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for us in the heavens:</hi> So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he keeps us by the power of the Spirit through faith to eternall ſalvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</label> Now having thus cleared the meaning of the word, it reſts that wee make uſe of it for our inſtructions: and the uſes that ariſe from
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:20885:177"/> it are two: the one ſerveth for rebuke, the other for comfort: the rebuke falleth on the Church of Rome: the comfort ſhall returne to us, and to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoule in whom the grace of God dwelleth. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke that ariſeth to the Church of Rome is this: in theſe words wee are commanded to crave pardon for our debts, in the plurall number, and indefinitely, now wee know this to bee true, that thoſe Propoſitions which are indefinite, are univerſall in correſpondence. Whilſt then wee crave pardon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of our debts, wee univerſally begge mercy, and pardon for all our ſinnes, for both originall and actuall ſins. For our ſinnes of infirmity, and our ſins of preſumption, for ſinfull omiſſions, and commiſſions: for the ſinfull thoughts of our heart, and
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:20885:177"/> words of our mouth, and actions of our converſation. Now in reſpect of all theſe wee have need to draw neere unto God, and to ſay, <hi>Forgive;</hi> What meane thoſe Doctors of the Romiſh Church to teach, that there is a ſort of ſinne, which in it ſelfe, and of it ſelfe is veniall; and that ſome onely are mortall: but it is cleare out of the word of God, that there is not any ſin which is not mortall: for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſinne is a breach of the law; and every ſinne and tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhall receive a juſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward. Hee that ſinneth without the law, ſhall periſh without the law: and hee that ſinneth under the law, ſhall bee judged by the law: and againe, <hi>The wages of ſinne is death:</hi> I graunt indeed if wee looke to that excellent price that was given for our ſinnes, no ſinnes are mortall;
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:20885:178"/> for ſuch is the worth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of that blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, which ſpeaketh better things then the blood of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,</hi> that whoſoever ſhall have part in it, ſhall ſtand without ſpot or blemiſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the preſence of the glory of God, with joy, and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall have but a drop of it to ſprinkle on the poſts of the doore of his ſoule, the deſtroying Angell ſhall not come neere him, but though his ſinnes were as red as ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, yet by vertue of his blood they ſhall bee as white as ſnow; But on the other part, if thou ſhalt looke upon thy ſinne in its owne nature: and becauſe of thy eſteeme, and account of it, it ſeeme veniall to thee, wilt thou therefore ſay that it is veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in it ſelfe? O foole that thou art, thou deceives thy owne ſoule. The ſmalleſt

The thornes that were in that crown were thy ſinnes: it was thy ſinnes that drew blood of him, and peirced his heart while there came blood and water out of it guſhing: and yet, vaine man that thou art, thou wilt ſay they are veniall; how canſt thou call that veniall, and of no weight, which was rated at ſo great a value, as the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the Sonne of God, the leaſt drop of whoſe blood was of more worth, then all the worme-eaten children of men on the earth?

The Saints of God have not known this dialect, nor ſpoken in this Idiom: it is but the voice of him that is dead in ſinne, and treſpaſſes: The Lord learne us to ſee our ſinnes aright, and then ſurely wee ſhall confeſſe that our ſinnes are not veniall, but mortall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as this ſerveth for the rebuke of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:20885:180"/> Church in Rome: ſo it ſerves alſo for our comfort, and conſolation, whom God hath delivered from the yoke of that bondage, and the night of that darkneſſe: for tell mee, O man, what greater conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can come to the ſoule of the Chriſtian, burthened with the weight of ſinne, then to ſay, thy ſinnes are forgiven thee? but ſuch is the force of theſe words, <hi>Forgive us our debts;</hi> for as in the word of debt, he ſheweth the weight of our miſery: ſo here in the words of forgiveneſſe, hee ſheweth us the riches of his mercy. Was it not I pray you, a great worke, &amp; a work paſſing the capacity of man, when God created the world, he made all things of nothing; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture telleth us, that of nothing nothing can bee? was it not a great worke to call for light out of the midſt of darkneſſe:
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:20885:180"/> and by the power of a naked word to make a glorious ſplendor of light ſhine out of the midnight of darknes? Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, was it not a great worke to animate a peece of clay, and by blowing on the duſt of the earth, to make it a living ſoule? All of theſe were great indeed as workes of creation, but as it was ſaid, behold, a greater then <hi>Salomon</hi> is here: ſo is there here in the matter of our rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption, a worke greater then all theſe: for loe he made not all things of nothing; but of that which is worſe then nothing, ſinne; for ſinne is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a privation. Hee brought light out of darknes: but here a greater light out of a greater darkneſſe; for when wee ſate in darkneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death, hee made a great light to ariſe unto us, for in his light hee made us to ſee light, hee ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:20885:181"/> our clay, and breathed the breath of life in our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrels, being dead in ſinnes and treſpaſſes, hee quickned and begot us to the hope of immortality: finally, here is that worke paſſing in excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and eminent above all humane admiration, that wee being his debtors for tenne thouſand talents, &amp; not having one farthing to pay him, hee hath freely forgiven us all our debt, to the admiration both of man and Angels: when the Angels who fell have not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a way of reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hee hath found out for poore man a way of peace: inſomuch that what man could not pay, hee hath freely, fully, and finally releaſed; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring nothing of man, but that hee ſhould in ſincerity ſay, <hi>Forgive,</hi> and it ſhall bee forgiven him. Now what more could hee doe to thee,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:20885:181"/> O man, or what leſſe could he require of thee? What more could hee do to thee, then lay downe his life for thee? and what leſſe could hee require of thee, then that in true ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row forthy ſinne, and in full aſſurance of his mercy, thou ſhouldſt come unto him, and ſay, Forgive mee, that ſo thou maiſt be forgiven. The word in it ſelfe is ſo full of comfort, I cannot as yet paſſe by it. There is another place in Scripture that lookes ſo like to this place like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> two twinnes, they are borne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they live together, and dye together. The place is the 12. of <hi>Matthew: Come to mee all yee that are weary and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and I will eaſe you.</hi> There, as the Saviour and Redeemer of the world, and the true Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian of ſoules that are ſicke, hee deſires him that is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſicke, to come to him, and
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:20885:182"/> he promiſeth to eaſe him, and give him reſt, but upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that hee feele his ſore, and acknowledge his burthen: Now it is remarkable that hee firſt promiſeth eaſe, and then reſt: firſt eaſe from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding power of ſin, &amp; next reſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the condemning power of ſin. It is even ſo here, that the ſpirituall Phyſition of our ſick &amp; wearied ſoules leadeth us to bee ſenſible of our ſoule, &amp; that by ſinne wee are made Gods debtors, and lyable to his judgements. In the next place, the cure of this our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is given: for wee ſhall no ſooner confeſſe and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our ſinnes to him, but hee ſhall forgive it. But you will ſay to mee, what is this that hee forgives mee? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, looke to the place of Scripture, immediately before cited, &amp; ſee there what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to eaſe thee of, as alſo
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:20885:182"/> all theſe things he here promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to forgive thee; hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth there to eaſe thee of all thy burthen of ſinne, of the law, of affliction. Of ſinne, for the burthen of it is as a talent of lead <hi>Zach.</hi> 5.6. And <hi>David</hi> ſaith, it is a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then too heavy for him to beare; Of the law, for it is a yoake, which neither wee nor our fathers, nor our forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were able to beare. <hi>Act.</hi> 15. Of affliction, for it is a weighty croſſe; and hee that follows Jeſus Chriſt muſt take it up, and follow him daily. Of ſinne, while he not knowing ſinne was made ſin for us. Of the Law, whilſt hee was made of a woman, and made under the law. Of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction: not by taking all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions from us, but by ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying them unto us both in their nature, and their end. Their nature, whilſt hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:20885:183"/> them teſtimonies of our adoption; their end, whilſt he by them keepes us to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life: for as the lyon that killed the Prophet, kept ſtill his dead body: ſo afflictions may well kill the naturall man, yet they do keepe the life of God in our ſoules. Now know then for your comfort that what there hee promiſed to eaſe us of, here hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to forgive, and to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give is more then to eaſe; for a Phyſitian will eaſe his patient for a while of a hard binding, which afterward he will binde againe. And a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter will eaſe his ſervant of the taske of captivity, and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, but afterwards hee will impriſon him. And finally, a beaſt will be eaſed of his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, for a while, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it will be impoſed, and laid upon him: but ſuch is the great and rich depth of the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:20885:183"/> mercy of our God; what hee eaſeth us of that hee forgiveth us: for while hee giveth par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to man, and ſpeakes peace to his ſoule, he pardoneth not as man pardoneth, neither gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth he peace, as man giveth peace: <hi>My peace I give you, my peace I leave with you, not as the world giveth peace, give I it unto you.</hi> The world and the children of men, when they pardon, their pardons are faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty three wayes: they are not totall, but partiall: not free, but conſtrained: neither finall, but for a time: not totall, for if they can forgive one fault, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is impardonable: not free and voluntary, but forced and conſtrained, either by reaſon of the importunity of friends, or hope in expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of gaine: not finall, for though they forgive for a time, yet their wrath and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of revenge is renued with
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:20885:184"/> any occaſion whatſoever. It is not ſo with our God, for what he eaſeth of that he forgiveth; when hee forgiveth, hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveth ingenuouſly, that is; freely, fully, finally; free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without any merit or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion on our part: fully, for hee forgiveth both the ſinne, and the puniſhment thereof. And finally, for hee forgiveth us both in this life, and that which is to come. What hath man then wherein hee can rejoyce? nothing but in the mercy, and free favour of God; for as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

               <p>HAving already handled of the word <hi>debt,</hi> and the word <hi>forgive,</hi> that which remaines of the text offereth it ſelſe to our conſideration: for though the gleanings of <hi>Ephratus</hi> bee better then the vintage of <hi>Abiezer,</hi> yet muſt the gleanings have their owne roome alſo, and every one in their owne order muſt be conſidered; which in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber are three, 1. for whom it is that wee put up this ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pardon, &amp; the word is plurall, not ſingular, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi> 2. The reaſon why we poure out our ſupplications in this plurall ſignification, and it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is <hi>wee,</hi> not <hi>I,</hi> that have ſinned alone, nor thou only nor any other alone, but all of us,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:20885:185"/> and therefore in a communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive appropriation wee call them ours. Thirdly, it is to be conſidered, of whom, and from whoſe hands it is that we are bold to begge this our releaſe and pardon. If in any of theſe particulars wee can make any further point of inſtruction to reſult, by the grace of God it ſhall be made knowne unto you. The firſt thing then wee have to ſpeake of this day is the perſons for whom, and in whoſe favour this petition and ſupplication is formed, It is cleare and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident out of the words themſelves, that the petition is not made for mee alone, nor for thee alone, nor for any man or woman in the world alone, but in common, thou for mee, and I thee, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of us for our ſelves and each of us for our neighbours as for our ſelves: for as <hi>Omnis
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:20885:185"/> orainata charitas incipit â ſeipſo; ſic etiam omnis regulata charitas terminatur in ſocio:</hi> wee have reaſon then to looke, firſt on our ſelves with the eyes of pitty, and from our ſelves with the eyes of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſeration on our neighbours; knowing them to bee men of the like infirmity, to which wee our ſelves are ſubject. Remember brethren, that God in his word hath taught us two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ſorts of communicative contemplation: the one poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at our ſelves from the conſideration of our brethren; the other pointing at our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren from the conſideration of our ſelves: the pitty that wee owe to our ſelves from the conſideration of our brethren, is recommended to us in the fifth chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galathians: Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, if any man bee fallen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you of infirmity, reſtore
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:20885:186"/> ſuch a one in the ſpirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, conſidering your ſelves leſt you alſo be tempted.</hi> The pitty that wee owe to our brethren from conſideration of our ſelves, is mentioned in many parts of the law, wherein we are commanded, not to hide our eyes from the neceſſities of any ſtranger, becauſe wee our ſelves were ſometimes ſtrangers in the land of Iſrael: it is ſo here with us, God will have us to remember, and pray for our neceſſities, not in our owne name alone, but alſo in the name of our brethren, and fellow members.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</label> In handling of the words the order is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and next to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the communion and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip that is couched up in the boſome of that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I will looke upon the order, which is very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:20885:186"/> for hee is teaching his diſciples to pray for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and remiſſion of ſinnes, but hee will have them firſt to looke on themſelves, and their owne neceſſities, and from themſelves not onely to conſider, but alſo to commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerate the neceſſities of their brethren: this is the path, and the true ſtraine, in the which God walkes; for our God is the God of order, and not of confuſion. And for cleering hereof, that order is firſt and originally eſtabliſhed in God himſelfe, and then from him a ſhadow of that order which is in him is derived to his creatures: I ſay firſt, order is poſitively and cheefly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in God himſelfe; for hee who is one in eſſence, is diſtinguiſhed in three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing individually one in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:20885:187"/> by vertue of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall eſſence, yet are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed by order of perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall exiſtence; the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in reſpect of order diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and preferred to the Sonne: and the Father and the Sonne both to the holy Ghoſt. Now from this chiefe and prime diſtinction of order which is amongſt the perſons of the bleſſed Trinity, there is made manifeſt amongſt the creatures a ſhadow of this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der alſo, and that in five ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall points of contemplation. Firſt, in the frame of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and earth. Secondly, in the civill ſocieties of men on earth <hi>(viz.)</hi> Commonwealths. Thirdly, in the ſpirituall ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men, his Church. Fourthly, in the homebred, and domeſticke families of men. And laſt of all, in the private carriages of man in his life and converſation. I ſay
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:20885:187"/> that God hath eſtabliſhed order in the frame and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of heaven and earth together: for there hee hath placed light and darkneſſe; that for the day, this for the night; there hee hath ſet the Sunne and the Moone, that by the heat of his influence to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale, this by her moiſture to water and refreſh; there hath hee placed the clouds, the bottels of raine, wherewith in due ſeaſon hee watereth <hi>Gedions</hi> fleece: there hath hee placed the wardrobe, and ſtorehouſe of the tempeſts of ſnow, haile, and winde, and all for the uſe of man, and thoſe other ſublunary crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that live and move on the face of the earth: that in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; all of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the footſteps of the order of the God of order may be ſeen &amp; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged: next to this celeſtiall order, &amp; ſubordination of the
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:20885:188"/> Spheares, and Celeſtiall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, behold hee hath fixed an order, and ſubordination alſo amongſt the ſonnes of men, in their ſecular and civill conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and commercement; for there hee hath placed ſome to command, and ſome to obey, ſome to governe, and ſome to be in ſubjection: their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and authority he calleth <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, our obedience and ſubordination, hee calleth <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, him that oppoſeth himſelfe to that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination. Thirdly, God hath ordained a juſt and beſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing order in his Church, in times, places, perſons, and proceedings. In times, a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is appointed for his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. In places, hee hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his Church to bee the place, wherein his name ſhall be called on. In perſons, ſome
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:20885:188"/> muſt teach, ſome muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and correct, and ſome muſt collect and diſtribute almes. In the proceedings al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the Church, there muſt bee order, for admonition muſt goe before cenſure, and ſmaller cenſures before the greater, according to that which is written, <hi>Let all things be done with order, and decencie.</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Fourthly, there is order alſo in our ſeverall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, for there hee placed the husband and the wife, the parent and the children, the maſter and the ſervant: and all to this end, that they who are in authority may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and they who are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate may obey. Finally, in every mans private carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age there is an order to bee kept, that wee walke not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately, as buſie bodies, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man talking and pratling
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:20885:189"/> of his neighbours charge, with the neglect, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible forgetfulneſſe of his owne: theſe the Apoſtle 2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3 calleth Buſie bodies, and <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. There are two things alſo which I had almoſt forgot, in which order is to be found: looke to the grave, yea and to hell it ſelfe: to the grave, for wee ſhall riſe in our order. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>The dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt.</hi> To hell, for there is a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elzebub</hi> the prince of devils. Now if in all things it hath pleaſed God to eſtabliſh an order, in the heavens, in the elementary ſpheares, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealths, and civill ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men, in the Church, &amp; communion of his Saints, in our private families, in our private charges and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, in our graves, and in hell it ſelfe; O how carefull ſhould man be to ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:20885:189"/> to order in this life, not onely in things temporall, but alſo in things ſpirituall; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring in all our ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which wee preſent to God: Firſt, the duty wee owe to God himſelfe: Secondly, the duty we owe to our own ſoules: Thirdly, the duty wee owe to our fellow-brethren, as mutuall members with us in the myſticall body of Jeſus Chriſt: and what better or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der can bee given and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the rule of thy life, then firſt, in all things, and above all things to looke unto God; from him to reflect thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation upon thy owne ſoule (as the ſeat of his Image) and from thy owne ſoule to caſt a ray, and beame of commiſeration on thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his neceſſities, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſuredly, that though in the matter of reckoning, <hi>rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis reddendi,</hi> every man muſt
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:20885:190"/> beare his owne burthen, yet in the matter of compaſſion, <hi>Infirmitatis tolerandae,</hi> every one of us is borne and bound to beare one anothers bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and to commiſerate not onely their temporall, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo their ſpirituall neceſſities, as well as our owne; for hee that wants the ſympathy, and fellow-feeling of a member of the body, declares himſelfe not to be of the body.</p>
               <p>But thou wilt ſay unto me, ſhal a man pray for that which hee beleeves, doe we not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg and confeſſe in our beleefe the forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes, why do wee then pray for that which wee doe beleeve?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, I doe not doubt, but according to the Articles of our Creed, God hath pardoned and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given mee my ſinnes, and my fellow brethren their ſinnes:
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:20885:190"/> yet will I pray daily, &amp; houre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their further pardon, whereby I may feele engraven in my heart the aſſurance of that pardon; for as every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſinne weakeneth the particular aſſurance of our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, ſo is it well done on our part, by renewed, &amp; reiterated ſupplications to renew and reiterate our confidence, and aſſurance of mercy: not that I thinke in any caſe the eternall and immutable pardon of God, given us from eternity in the blood of Jeſus, can ever bee fully, or finally loſt or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: no, no, the gifts and callings of God are without change or alteration: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the frequencie of our ſinnes doe weaken our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and hope of pardon, therefore it is requiſite that by the reiteration of our prayers, wee may ſtrengthen and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new our hope &amp; confidence of
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:20885:191"/> remiſſion: and that as oft as our ſinnes are reiterated and renewed.</p>
               <p>But it may bee yet enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, why the word ſhould be plurall, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> and not <hi>Mee:</hi> It is written in the Scripture: There is a ſinne for which thou ſhouldſt not pray: and againe, <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen.</hi> Now brethren, if there bee ſome ſinnes, and ſome ſinners, for whom wee ſhould not pray: how is it that we are commanded here to pray for all men as well as for our ſelves?</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, I may, and ſhould pray for the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſinners in the world: the reaſon is, becauſe the purpoſe of God, concerning the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation of man, though one in it ſelfe, yet is two wayes to bee conſidered of us: firſt, as hidden, and kept cloſe in the boſome of
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:20885:191"/> the Father. Secondly; as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and manifeſted by his word: whilſt the ſalvation and reprobation of man is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne to God, wee are bound to pray for them, and the pardon of their ſinnes: but if at any time God in his word make their rejection manifeſt, then, and then onely is it time for us to ſhut up our mouthes, and not to pray for them. This truth ſhall be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by examples: whilſt <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> was ignorant of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God, concerning <hi>Saul,</hi> hee ceaſed not continually to pray for him: but how ſoone God once made his ſecret purpoſe of rejection knowne to <hi>Samuel,</hi> hee ſtopped his mouth, &amp; prayed no more for him. Whilſt <hi>David</hi> knew not the will of God, concerning his child begotten with <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheba,</hi> hee faſted, prayed, and would not be comforted:
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:20885:192"/> but how ſoone God made his ſecret will manifeſt, by the death of the child, hee mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no more, but riſeth ſtraight, refreſheth himſelfe, and eateth bread. Finally, this was the ground of all that partiality, which by many is condemned in <hi>Rebecca,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her ſonne <hi>Eſau:</hi> ſhee was acquainted with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret purpoſe of God concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him: <hi>I have loved Iacob, and hated Eſau.</hi> And againe, <hi>The elder ſhall ſerve the yonger.</hi> Thus, ſo long as God makes not his ſecret purpoſe known, concerning man, wee are bound to pray for all men: but ſo ſoone as God maketh knowne his will concerning mans laſt end, where God cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to love, we ſhould ceaſe to pray. It is the part therfore of a good Chriſtian to pray for all men: to love them that hate us: to bleſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that curſe
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:20885:192"/> us, and to pray for them that perſecute us, that wee not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overcome of evill, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercoming evil with goodnes, may bee perfect, as our Father in heaven is perfect. Now this being ſpoken concerning the perſons for whom we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up this our ſupplication, we muſt come &amp; conſider the reaſon wherfore we muſt pray ſo, and the reaſon is, becauſe our ſins are ours. <hi>[Our.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take heed, I pray you to this (my brethren) The reaſon why wee crave pardon of our ſinnes is: becauſe ſinnes are ours, and beſides theſe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in the world is ours. I have ſaid that ſinne is truly ours; This ſhall ſerve for the doctrinall part: And that nothing in the world is ours beſides ſinne, this ſhall ſerve for the morall part. Firſt then ſinne is truely ours, in three reſpects: firſt, in reſpect of
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:20885:193"/> patrimony: ſecondly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of practiſe: thirdly, in reſpect of purchaſe. In reſpect of patrimony; The ſinnes of our firſt parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> are ours. In reſpect of practice, our actuall ſinnes are ours. In reſpect of purchaſe, the ſinnes of our neighbours are made ours. The ſinnes of our firſt parents are ours: for they not onely ſinned for themſelves, but for us alſo, they before us, wee in them, and after them. Do wee not impute the bitterneſſe of the ſtreame to the fountaine, &amp; the rottennes of the branch to the root? yes ſurely, ſo is it with us, hee was the root, wee are the branches; he the fountaine, we the ſtreames: and to expreſſe this more clearly, let me aske you that are acquainted with the art of numbers, if that any figure in the firſt place doth ſignifie any more but it ſelfe
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:20885:193"/> onely, yet by the addition of a cypher, 1.2.3. or 4 multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth the ſignification from ten to hundreds, from hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds to thouſands, and from thouſands to millions. It is even ſo with us, <hi>Adam</hi> &amp; <hi>Eve</hi> ſinned, and being conſidered in their own place ſinned alone &amp; for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves, but being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered with our addition, as being in their loines, wee as cyphers have multiplied their burthen, they as figures have made us ſignificative: they then have not ſinned alone, but we alſo in them, and with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; their ſins are not theirs alone, but ours alſo by copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip. Secondly, ſin is ours by practiſe, for as our firſt parents ſinned, and by their ſinne made ſinne ours originally: ſo wee alſo by walking in the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of our fathers, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after their examples, have made that which was
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:20885:194"/> ours by deſcent from our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to be ours actually: for as by one man ſinne entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, and by ſinne death, ſo death hath univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally runne over all men, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that in one man all men have ſinned; yea further, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee have actually built up the ſepulchers of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, therefore tribulation and anguiſh is upon the ſoule of every man that doth evill, to the Jew firſt and alſo to the Grecian. Laſtly, I ſay ſin is ours by purchaſe, by drawing on us the guilt and puniſhment of ours neighbours ſinne. And now thou ſhalt enquire of mee how a man can bee guilty of his neighbours ſinne.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, it may bee done five manner of wayes. 1. By connivence. 2. By negligence. 3. By aſſent. 4. By example. 5. By provocation. By con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence, winking at other
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:20885:194"/> mens faults, when wee ſhould reprove them; to this effect it is written, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. <hi>Thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy neighbours ſinne, leſt thou beare ſinne for him.</hi> By negligence; in not correcting ſuch for ſin, as are under our authority. This was the ſinne of <hi>Eli</hi> in ſparing his ſonnes: and this is the threatning of <hi>Ezechiah</hi> in caſe of ſilence at the ſinnes of his people. <hi>Ezec.</hi> 3. By aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: Thus <hi>Aaron</hi> was guilty of Idolatry, when he aſſented to make the golden calfe. By example; thus <hi>Ieroboam</hi> is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked that hee made Iſrael to ſinne: And <hi>David,</hi> that hee made the name of God to bee ill ſpoken of amongſt the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. Laſt of all, by provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: this was the ſinne of <hi>Lots</hi> daughters to their inceſtuous father: and <hi>Baalams</hi> ſinne to Iſrael, with the daughters of <hi>Moab.</hi> This then being the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinall
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:20885:195"/> part ſhewing how ſinnes are ours: the morall part ſucceedeth: in which we muſt cleare this, That nothing is ſo really ours, as ſinne. That wee may the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this we muſt know that there is no creature on earth, ſo naked and indigent as man: for naked hee was borne, and naked ſhall he returne againe: and hee hath no peculiar or proper thing in the world, that hee can juſtly call his, but ſinne and infirmity. To prove this let us take a ſurvey of all the things in the world: Is wealth ours? No, for riches are painfully gotten, carefully kept, and wofully loſt: and yet when we have moſt adoe with them; like an eagle ſhee takes her wings, and flies away ſo ſwiftly, as ſhe cannot bee recovered: and though they bide with us till the end of our dayes, yet then they
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:20885:195"/> take their leave, and wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve nothing, ſaving a woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded conſcience for the abuſe of them. Is beauty ours? No, ſurely, let but a dayes ſickneſſe take thee by thy hand, and loe thou ſhalt find nothing but age &amp; wrinkles, &amp; the lineaments of death, &amp; the characters of deformity which ſhall make thee affraid of thy ſelfe. Is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor thine? no ſurely, it vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as the morning cloud, &amp; as the ſmoake of a chimney, &amp; is liker to nothing then our Sun dyalls which point out the houres, ſo long as the Sunne ſhineth, but if a cloud ſhall intervene, ſerve for nothing, but are a dimme ſtatue. Is ſtrength thine? No, let God but write one line of tolerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and put it in the hand of thine, and ſtraight like <hi>Beltaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer,</hi> thy knees ſhall beat one againſt another: And with <hi>Iob</hi> thou ſhalt ſcrape thy ſores
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:20885:196"/> with a potſherd on the dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill. Finally, is that breath that wee draw into our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrels ours? no ſurely, it is but ſucked up, and borrowed from the next aire: If God lend thee power, thou canſt both exhale and evaporate it, but if he ſay not <hi>Amen,</hi> it ſhall choake thee in the paſſage. Or is this body that thou beareſt about thee thine? No ſurely, it is of the duſt, and to the duſt it ſhall returne againe. Pittifull &amp; wretched man that thou art, what is thine? no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſin, and a wounded conſcience for ſin: &amp; theſe are ours by patrimony, by practice, and by purchaſe, of the which we can never be freed till we put off, and change our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, practiſe, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Our patrimony, by ſhewing our ſelves heires, not to the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> but to the ſecond. Our practiſe, by walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:20885:196"/> no more after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit; for if wee walke after the fleſh we ſhall dye, but if wee walke after the ſpirit wee ſhall live. Our purchaſe, whilſt wee crucifie our ſelves to the world, and the world to us, that the life of Jeſus may bee made manifeſt in our mortall bodies; and whilſt wee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the things that are behind us, &amp;c. and account all things as dirt and dung to us in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the advantage that wee have in the croſſe of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing remarkable in the words, is the perſon at whoſe hands wee ſue for this releaſe, and pardon of ſinne, which is neither man nor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, nor Saint departed, but God alone: for all theſe, with the wiſe virgins, haue adoe with their owne lamps: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept this onely, to wit, God,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:20885:197"/> for it is againſt him onely that wee ſinne, and it is hee onely who can forgive ſinne: and if pardon of ſinne bee in the Church, it is onely a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall declaration, no abſolute condonation.</p>

               <p>NExt to the conſideration of that part of this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is ſupplicatory, wee come to that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtipulatory. The firſt part was ſupplicatory in begging pardon of our ſinnes againſt God: this carries the reſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the covenant: and promiſeth in our names the pardon and forgiveneſſe of our brethren whenſoever they ſinne againſt us. The co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of it ſelfe, &amp; in it ſelfe,, is hard, &amp; ſo much the harder
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:20885:197"/> by how much it hath both the fairer provocations for obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the fouler ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings in diſobedience. It hath the fairer provocations to obedience: for in all the covena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts that God hath made with man, there is none like to this. God hath made three covenants with man: a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, a Legall, and an Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall. The naturall covenant was made with man in the day of creation. The legall in the day of his temporall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption: and the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call in the fulneſſe of time when the Sonne of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made man, and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinne, was made ſinne for our ſakes, and expiated our ſinnes by his ſufferings. The tenor of the firſt covenant was naturall and juſt. Naturall becauſe he made man in nature perfect, and juſt, becauſe hee required nothing of man, but
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:20885:198"/> that to the obedience whereof hee had given him naturall ability. The ſecond covenant was in ſome condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion preternaturall, and juſt: preternaturall, in ſo farre that nature could not obey it: yet juſt, becauſe he once ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened nature to obey it. The third covenant was ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and gracious. Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, in requiring things that nature could not give: yet ſupernaturally gracious, in finding out a remedie for the defect of nature, making the Sonne of God to become man, and him that knew not ſinne, to bee made ſinne for us, that wee in him might bee made partakers of the riches of the mercy of God. Now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I pray you, what I have ſaid: I ſaid that this covenant was ſo much the harder, by how much the provocations were gracious, and the diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bediences
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:20885:198"/> foule. To have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt the covenant of nature was foule indeed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nature was made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and able to doe what was required of the naturall man. To ſinne againſt the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of workes, (which I called preternaturall) was foule alſo: for howſoever nature was then corrupt and weake, yet their deliverance from the bondage of Egypt prefigurating to them the hope of a better deliverance, and therefore rendred the ſmell of their diſobedience the more odious and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, by how much in it they had not onely the pardon of their naturall uncleanneſſe, but alſo the hope of a better inheritance ſealed up unto them. But above all, the breach of this covenant made with us in the blood of Jeſus under the Goſpell, is ſo much the
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:20885:199"/> more foule, and abominable, by how much the ſeale of the covenant was gracious and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. For the condition of the firſt covenant was ſtrict, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe naturall. The condition of the ſecond was fearfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſupernaturall for the time. But the condition of the laſt covenant was eaſie, be cauſe gracious: and our rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion ſo much the more foule, becauſe it was eaſie: and to the corrupt nature of man, ſo much the more hard, by how much it was facilitated by the obedience of another, for it is written, the ſpirit that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in us luſteth after envie. And againe, <hi>I do not the good that I would, but the evill that I would not:</hi> &amp; yet the Law in it ſelfe is pure &amp; holy, righteous, and juſt: Well then, it hath pleaſed God in his wiſedome to adjoyn theſe words <hi>(As we for give, &amp;c.)</hi> To the former,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:20885:199"/> to be a ſeale of his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and withall to be a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our uncleanneſſe, and prevarication: A ſeale of his righteouſneſſe, in that hee hath freely forgiven us our ſinnes. A ſeale of our unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and prevarication, in that wee cannot forgive one another.</p>
               <p>Now the words being thus taken up in their dependence, it is requiſite that wee looke upon them in their ſeverall ſtations, and from thence ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their ſeverall uſes for our inſtruction.</p>
               <p>If wee ſhall narrowly look upon them, foure things offer themſelves to our conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Firſt, a condition im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to man, ſerving for the ſeale of the covenant, <hi>As.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to whom this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is both propoſed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, <hi>wee.</hi> Thirdly, the duty annexed to the condition,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:20885:200"/> 
                  <hi>Forgive.</hi> Fourthly, the perſons to whom wee are obliged in this duty: to our debters or them that finne againſt us. To returne to the firſt of theſe, the condition, <hi>As,</hi> the words are diverſly read in divers E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give us our debts, as wee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give our debtors. Luke</hi> in his 11. Chapter ſaith, <hi>Forgive us our ſinnes, for wee even for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them that ſinne againſt us.</hi> And according to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of the readings, ſo hath there alſo diverſitie of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of the words ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen. Some looking too ſtrictly upon the particle of ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude here uſed, <hi>As,</hi> have been led a little to doubt of the free pardon and remiſſion of their ſinnes: For if God ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give man no otherwiſe then man forgiveth his neighbour, then for the moſt part, our ſinnes ſhall neither bee fully,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:20885:200"/> freely nor finally forgiven: for as I have ſhowne you in our laſt Sermon, mans pardon is but partiall, conſtrained, and for a time: and the reſt laid up againſt the day of revenge, and his more full retaliation. On the other part, the reading of this prayer, as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Luke</hi> hath recorded it to us, by way of cauſality, in the word, <hi>For,</hi> hath led many to preſumption, thinking that if they can par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don their neighbours their ſinnes, then God is bound to pardon them theirs, and ſo they would inforce by way of merit their pardon at Gods hands. But that the words may be cleared, and the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God in them freed from both theſe impoſtures, know that the word uſed by <hi>Matthew,</hi> is not ſet downe by way of parity, but by way of ſeale. And the word uſed by <hi>Luke,</hi> is not ſet downe by way
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:20885:201"/> of cauſality, but by way of commiſeration. I ſay, that the word uſed by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Matthew, as,</hi> is not a word of parity, and reciprocation, but of ſeale: ſo that the purpoſe and meaning of God in it, is not to tye man to that ſtrict and preciſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of his conformity, which either the ſeverity of his Law, or the ſincerity of his nature requireth, but in mercy hee leadeth man to bee confident, and aſſured of the remiſſion of his ſinnes at Gods hands, by the ſeale of his owne heart: for by this, as by an indeleble character, ſhall man ſeale to himſelfe the aſſurance of Gods mercy, if hee himſelfe can bee mercifull: For it is written, <hi>Condemnation mercileſſe ſhall be to the man that will not ſhew mercy: but mercy rejoyceth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt judgement.</hi> Againe, on the other part, whilſt S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Luke</hi> forbeareth the word <hi>As,</hi> for
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:20885:201"/> feare of wounding the weake conſcience, and uſeth the word, <hi>For,</hi> it is not to make the word cauſall, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative: for he ſetteth not down that word, as a cauſe or meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious occaſion procuring, and adjuring God to bee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull unto us, but the word is a word of commiſeration, and pitty, drawing the argument from the leſſe to the more, and importuning God onely with the remembrance of our weakneſſe: as if hee ſhould have ſaid, If we who are evill, can forgive in any condition, O thou who art rich in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, forgive us fully, freely, and finally.</p>
               <p>I have looked thus u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the word in the native, &amp; genuine ſignification there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, freeing both the wounded conſcience from the terrour of ſeverity, and withall putting a bridle in the lips of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:20885:202"/> man, leſt at any time hee ſhould runne out: It reſteth now that wee make uſe of the word in the true ſignification thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</label> The uſe wee make is this: I ſee heaven is ſo good a thing, that all men would be at it; and mercy ſo ſweet, that every man would have a part and portion in it: Yet, O behold the vanity of man, whilſt wee all ayme at the end, wee are forgetfull of the way: and whilſt we gape after the felicity of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, wee forget the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Will you enquire the cauſe? It is this; the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of God are peacefull, and the promiſes of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards are rich and plentifull, but the way to their fruition is thorny and hard. Hee co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted with <hi>Adam</hi> the dominion over his creatures, and the fruition of all the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:20885:202"/> but when the Impoſtor came, hee made the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hard, and in ſo doing, hee ſhut them up from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evill. Hee covenanteth with <hi>Abraham</hi> the poſſeſſion of the land of Canaan; but the condition was hard, <hi>Offer to mee thy firſt borne of the free woman, Iſaack.</hi> Hee covenants with <hi>Gedion</hi> the deliverance of his people from the tyranny of <hi>Midian,</hi> but the condition was hard, <hi>Cut downe thy fathers grove, &amp;c.</hi> neither are theſe termes hard, as being the voice of the Law, but what is more, they have beene of the very like, and equall ſeverity under the Goſpell: For will you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to whom it is that Chriſt Jeſus promiſeth comfort, it is to them that mourne. To whom promiſeth he the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, but to them that are poore in ſpirit. To
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:20885:203"/> whom ſatisfaction? onely to thoſe who hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe. And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, to whom doth hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe eaſe and relaxation from their ſinnes? onely to thoſe who are weary and laden; and to ſuch as take up their croſſe and follow him daily. O then what a folly is this amongſt the ſonnes of men, to ſnatch at the grace of the covenant, with the miſ-priſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yet behold, for reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our weakneſſe in this point, it hath pleaſed our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer to annexe the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the covenant; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, that unleſſe we be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the reſtipulation, wee cannot bee able to crave the benefit of the firſt bargian: for as it is generally holden a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, that our one handed contract cannot ſtand, ſo is it alſo with God, and us. Hee never broke his part of
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:20885:203"/> the covenant hee made, nor forfeited at any time his part of the obligation: the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is onely ours: for though hee keepe, wee breake: and though hee covenant mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, yet wee ſcorne the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation: but alas, wee do pittifully deceive our ſelves, it ſhall not bee ſo with us: as it was ſaid to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> in the caſe of his bribery, when hee thought to purchaſe the grace of God by money, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> anſwered him, <hi>Thou haſt no part nor portion with us in this inheritance, becauſe thy heart is not upright in the ſight of God; but thou art in the gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and in the bond of iniquity, Act.</hi> 8.21. So ſhall it be ſaid to us in the time wee depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate our iniquities: thou haſt no part nor portion, O man, in the worke of mercy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou wilt not bee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull: and I will not forgive
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:20885:204"/> thee (ſhall God ſay) becauſe thou wilt not forgive thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>From the particle of ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, wee come now to the perſons to whom this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milary practice of pardon is impoſed: and the word is plurall and indefinite: plurall, <hi>Wee:</hi> indefinite, tending and extending it ſelfe to all ſexes, ſorts and conditions of men whatſoever. When I reade and ponder theſe words, I cannot but call to minde ſome other places and paſſages of Scripture, in the which the like peremptory dealing is expreſſed to us. I remember, <hi>Iacob</hi> on a time wreſtling with the Angell of the covenant, the great Angell ſeeing that he could not prevaile, ſaid to <hi>Iacob, Let mee goe I pray thee,</hi> but <hi>Iacob</hi> anſwered, <hi>I will not let thee goe till thou bleſſe mee.</hi> Likewiſe, <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:20885:204"/> deſired to goe up with Iſrael to the land of promiſe, anſwered, <hi>I will not goe on for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, except thou goe with mee.</hi> And as it hath beene the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and care of the children of God to wreſtle with him for the attaining of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, ſo it hath beene alwaies the care of God to wreſtle with his Saints in the day that hee would bleſſe them, to propound unto them a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of difficulty, by the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience whereof hee might draw them from themſelves to an abſolute repoſing and relying upon his mercy. This is his practice alſo here, wherein howſoever he be a God rich in mercy, ſlow to anger, and of great kindneſſe, forgiving tranſgreſſion, iniquity, and ſinne, yet when hee diſpences his pardon, and diſpoſeth his love mercifully towards us, that hee may ſeale the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:20885:205"/> thereof to us, hee will wreſtle with us a little while, in controlling the humour of our corrupt nature, that when hee lets us ſee our corruptions ſubdued to him, wee may by way of argumentation from the leſſe to the more, aſſure our ſelves of the riches of his favour towards us: So that the meaning of the word is this: Man, wouldſt thou have favour? ſurely I thinke thou wouldſt: beginne thou then firſt, thou madeſt the firſt fault, make the firſt amends, for it is reaſon ſo to bee. What art thou in reſpect of mee? or what is thy pardon in reſpect of mine? What art thou, I ſay, in reſpect of mee? Duſt and aſhes, and to duſt and aſhes ſhalt thou returne againe. But loe, I am a great and incorruptible God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom the heavens are not pure, and in whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:20885:205"/> the Angels doe cover their faces, as uncapable of my glory. And as there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt thee a finite and corruptible creature, and mee an infinite and incorruptible Creator, ſo is there alſo as large an extent of difference betwixt thy wayes and my wayes. What is thy mercy in reſpect of mine? but a moat in reſpect of a mountaine, a ſparke in reſpect of a fire, a drop in reſpect of the Ocean, and nothing in reſpect of that which is more then all things. So that if thou wouldſt have mee, who am infinite, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, eternall, and incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, opening to thee the rich treaſures of my incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible, and unſearchable mercies, it firſt muſt bee thy care who art a finite, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, and worme-eaten crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to extend the bowels of thy compaſſion, and to bee
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:20885:206"/> mercifull to thy fellow bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren elſe how ſhall I forgive thee thy thouſand Talents, if thou forgive not the hundreth pence owing to thee. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18 well then, the propoſition is plurall and indefinite, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending all ſexes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of men.</p>

When <hi>Naaman</hi> in diſobedience to the Prophet went home, and his leproſie cleaving to him, hee was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſed by his ſervants, and following their counſels, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a ſweet and deſired purgation from his diſeaſe. When <hi>Balaam</hi> the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had twice ſmitten his Aſſe unjuſtly, at the third time his rebuke made him wiſe. When the Centurion invited Chriſt to heale his daughter,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:20885:206"/> in proteſtation of his unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, hee confeſſed, that when hee ſaid to this ſervant, goe, hee goeth, and to this come, and hee cometh: Now I ſay, ſince all theſe have found obedience, how is it that our Redeemer Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus commanding us to forgive our brethren can never finde obedience? O what a rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing is man, and how deafe are the paſſions and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations of his heart. Whilſt Jeſus Chriſt walked in our fleſh, hee ſpake to the windes and they were ſtill, to the ſeas and they were calme, and to the devills themſelves, and they were diſpoſſeſſed. When hee was upon the croſſe hee cryed with a loud voyce, when hee gave up the ghoſt, and loe the Sunne was dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, the Moone refuſed to ſhew her light, the rocks were rent aſunder, the graves open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:20885:207"/> the dead aroſe, and the vale of the Temple was rent from the top to the bottome: when hee roſe the third day, the earth ſhooke &amp; trembled, the ſtone was removed from the doore of the grave, and the Angels of God came and miniſtred to him: when hee aſcended on high, he led (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promiſe) capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity captive, hee gave gifts to men and ſent the Comforter to the world, to convince the world of ſinne, of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and of judgement; and yet behold, notwithſtanding all this royall power, and ſuper-eminent Majeſtie, by the which hee was acknowledged to bee the Sonne of God in the eſtate of his humility; Now when hee is exalted to the Throne of his glory, and ſits at the right hand of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie of God the Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold hee calls, and wee will
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:20885:207"/> not come; hee ſtretches out his armes, and wee refuſe to bee imbraced; hee commands, and wee diſobey; hee requires, that as wee would bee forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, wee ſhould forgive, and wee refuſe the grace of the covenant, becauſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. But what ſhall I ſay to thee, O man? I will ſay with S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>

It
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:20885:208"/> were better for us brethren to run another courſe, &amp; to do as the diſciples did in the 8. of <hi>Matthew</hi> the 20. when the ſtorme of the ſea waxed vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in ſuch meaſure that the ſhip was almoſt covered with waves, the diſciples ranne to Chriſt and awoke him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Maſter, helpe us, for wee periſh.</hi> The danger for the time was theirs, they were in perill of drowning: but the ſpirituall morality is ours: Wee are all in the world a turbulent and tempeſtuous ſea, Chriſt hath ſevered us from the world by his ſhip his Church: while wee are in the world, though not of the world, wee ſhall not want ſtormes and tempeſts ready to overflow us: Chriſt Jeſus is our skipper, and ſits at the helme, ſo long as hee a wakes, and watches over us by his providence, wee are ſafe and
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:20885:208"/> ſecure: but if hee fall aſleepe, and ſeeme but to winke at our perturbations &amp; eminent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, wee periſh except wee awake him.

               <p>IN handling of this Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, two things are chiefly remarkable, the introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Petition it ſelfe. The introduction is in the word, <hi>And:</hi> The petition hath two parts, the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines a deprecation, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond a ſupplication: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation is in theſe words, <hi>(And lead us not, &amp;c.)</hi> the Supplication in theſe words, <hi>But deliver us, &amp;c.</hi> In the handling of theſe, I will firſt looke on the word or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of introduction, which is conjunctive, <hi>And:</hi> by this particle this Petition is tyed to both theſe precedent Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, which concerneth man and his neceſſities whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bodily or ſpirituall. And
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:20885:210"/> firſt it is remarkable, that by this particle, the Petition is tyed to that, wherein wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to God our bodily neceſſities: for whilſt wee ſaid, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread,</hi> wee confeſſe three things to God: the firſt was that wee had our life on him: for in him, and in him alone wee live, wee move, and have our beeing. The ſecond was, that wee had the meanes of him, and him alone, by which that life was maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in us: for unleſſe hee of his mercy ſhould ſend a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on our travels, all ſhould bee in vaine: For wee may eate, and not be ſatisfied; wee may cover our makedneſſe, and not be warme; wee may ſow much and reape little, we may earne wages, and put them in a bottomleſſe bagge, except hee open his hand and fill us with his bleſſing, for then, and
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:20885:210"/> no otherwiſe are wee ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. And thirdly, whilſt wee begged of God the meanes of our ſatisfaction, ſo alſo wee begged them of him in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate manner and meaſure: not to give us over-little, leſt wee ſhould for want ſteale, and Gods name ſhould bee diſhonoured by our practice: Nor yet over-much, leſt by reaſon of our plenty wee ſhould waxe wanton, forget the rocke from whence wee were hewen, and ſo in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, periſh, &amp; ſay, <hi>Who is the Lord?</hi> Now having beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged theſe things in that Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this Petition is duely conjoyned unto it by this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of conjunction, <hi>And:</hi> for ſince it is certaine, that man is a weake and fraile creature, in the day of his want ready to runne an ill courſe; and in the day of his proſperity ready to grow
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:20885:211"/> proud, and miſ-know God, there can nothing bee better ſaid, then, <hi>Lead us not into temptation,</hi> that is to ſay, ſince Sathan is ready at all times, in all places, and by all occaſions to tempt us to ſinne: Lord watch thou over us by thy grace, and good ſpirit, that in the day of our want, wee ſinne not againſt thee by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, and in the day of our wealth and abundance, wee ſinne not againſt thee by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, but learne in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſtate wee bee, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be content, for naked wee came into the world, and naked we ſhall returne againe. Again, by the ſame co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>junctive particle, <hi>And,</hi> this Petition is duly tyed to that wherein wee begged of God the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and pardon of our ſinnes, and that for three ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall cauſes or reſpects: firſt, to teach us to avoid ſecurity;
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:20885:211"/> Secondly, to teach us the truth of Gods covenant: and thirdly, to teach us to ſubmit our ſelves to the condition of the covenant. It teacheth us to beware of ſecurity, for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the remiſſion of ſinne, temptation followeth: and hee is a great foole, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving once gotten the victory over ſinne, cries to himſelfe a perpetuall, and permanent peace: yes furely, for the eſtate of the ſervant is not above his maſter. Whilſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than dealt with our head Chriſt Jeſus, in tempting him, though hee mightily decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe to bee the Sonne of God, by reſiſting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling his temptations, yet in the end it is ſaid, that Sathan left him but for a ſeaſon: If then this hath beene the lot and portion of the head, what ſhall become of us that are members? If hee dealt ſo
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:20885:212"/> with the greene tree, what ſhall become of us who are withered branches? And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, if this hath beene the portion of him who was the cedar of Lebanon, what ſhall become of us, who are poore buſhes of Iſop at the foot of the wall? No, no, O man, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not thy ſelfe, and after the foile of a ſinne, over which it may pleaſe God in his mercy to give thee victory and peace of conſcience in the blood of Jeſus, doſt thou thinke that Sathan can bee ſo cowardly, that after one foile, hee dare no more to aſſault thee? No, be ſure of this, ſo long as the ſtrong man keepes the hold, all things are in peace: but if with <hi>Iacob</hi> thou ſhalt labour to returne to the land of thy nativity, <hi>Laban</hi> ſhall purſue thee, and unleſſe the God of thy fathers, make his fall upon him, hee will
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:20885:212"/> not onely kill thee, but alſo the mother upon the young ones. For though for a while hee ſeeme to leave his habitation, yet if thou do not watch over the houſe of thy ſoule, hee ſhall returne, and bring with him, ſeaven other ſpirits worſe then himſelfe, and the laſt eſtate of thy ſoule ſhall be worſe then the firſt. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it ſerves to teach us the truth of Gods covenant, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which we have not onely cauſe of joy and ſpirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, but alſo reaſon to ſerve the Lord in feare, and walke before him in trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. For the covenant of mercy that God maketh with man in the blood of Chriſt, hath two parts, the firſt carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a promiſe of the remiſſion of our ſinnes: the ſecond a promiſe that hee will write his law in our hearts. Now this is that new covenant
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:20885:213"/> which God promiſeth to make with us under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, of which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> writing to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, tells us, that the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor thereof is not formed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenor of a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall commandement, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the power and law of an endleſſe life. For to what uſe I pray you, ſhall the remiſſion of our by-gone ſinnes ſerve us, if when we are once waſhed and cleanſed, wee ſhall ſtraight with the dogge returne to our vomit; or with the ſowe, to the puddle of our tranſgreſſions againe? It is well added by the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God for mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to ſay, no ſooner, <hi>Forgive us our ſinnes,</hi> then ſtraight way to ſubjoyne, <hi>And lead us not into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> for by this meanes wee get the covenant of God made ſure and perfect to us,
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:20885:213"/> whilſt hee firſt ſealeth in us the oblituration of the old hand writing of ſinne that was againſt us, and in the next roome writeth his law in our hearts, and captivateth our affections to his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, by the addition of this Petition to the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately former, we were taught to ſerve the Lord in feare: for if this be our miſery, that our enemies are watchfull and malicious, omitting no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſnares, and temptations that can entrap; and if this bee our infirmity and weakneſſe, that of our ſelves wee cannot ſtand one moment in the grace received: why ſhould wee not ſerve the Lord in feare, and rejoyce before him in all trembling? For as this is the comforr of comforts for a Chriſtian to heare this ſaid to him, <hi>Sonne, bee of good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:20885:214"/> thy ſinnes bee forgiven thee;</hi> So let this bee the ſquare by which hee ruleth and ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his future obedience: <hi>Sinne no more, leſt a worſe thing befall thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus having cleared to you the dependence of this Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with that, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread:</hi> and with that alſo, <hi>Forgive us our ſinnes:</hi> It reſteth now that wee conſider the words of the Petition it ſelfe, and firſt thoſe which are deprecatory, and then thoſe that are ſupplicatory: Firſt, <hi>Lead us not into temptation:</hi> and then, <hi>But deliver us from evill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lead us not into temptation:</hi> For the better underſtanding of the words, wee muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that they are meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoricall, and propounded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us by way of a figurative tranſlation; for in them God teacheth his Church to put up
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:20885:214"/> her ſupplications to God: Now wee muſt underſtand, that although the Church bee but one in her ſelfe, as her God, head, and husband is one, yet is ſhee alwayes propoſed to us under the ſhadow of two ſeverall conſiderations. For ſometimes ſhee is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as in heaven, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as ſhee is on earth: that part of the Church which is in heaven, is <hi>in patria,</hi> in her country: That part which is on earth, is but <hi>in via,</hi> upon the way: when wee enter into heaven, wee are <hi>comprehenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res:</hi> whilſt wee are on earth, wee are but <hi>viatores:</hi> they that are in heaven are called the triumphant Church; they that are on earth, the militant. Now by both of theſe it is cleare, that the Church here on earth hath much adoe: for will you looke upon her as a pilgrim; ſhe hath enough
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:20885:215"/> to doe with all her wits to keepe the right way; for though the way bee patent enough, yet becauſe it is thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, wee had need of a guide to lead us in it, that when wee fall and ſtumble, hee may lift us up againe: For this <hi>Iacob</hi> confeſſed, <hi>Few and evill have beene the dayes of my pilgrimage.</hi> Again, will we looke upon the Church here on earth, as upon an army, for ſo <hi>Iob</hi> confeſſed, <hi>Iob</hi> 7. <hi>Mans life is a warfare on earth:</hi> There we have need of a head and a leader too: for unleſſe there bee Captaines over hundreds and over thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, it is impoſſible that we can either fight in order, or report a due victory: and there ſhall nothing bee heard in our campe but confuſion, and the voice of him that is overcome; ſo that howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the metaphor ſtandeth, it is cleare, that wee are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:20885:215"/> weake and fraile crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſubject to many wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings, and many aſſaults, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and againſt the which wee can neither ſtand, nor prevaile, unleſſe our Leader and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine bee with us, and in his power make us victorious. The metaphor therefore ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving equally to preſent unto us, both our pilgrimage, and our warfare: I would rather lay hold on the laſt, and ſhew you what are the references of our ſpirituall warfare, in which wee ſtand: ſeeing the matter is ſo clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, and pointed out to us elſewhere: for in the Epiſtle to the Epheſians, the Apoſtle telleth us, that wee muſt not onely fight againſt fleſh and blood, but alſo againſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and powers, and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall wickedneſſe, and the Prince of darkneſſe, and the god that ruleth powerfully in
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:20885:216"/> in the children of diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. That wee may therefore hold ſtill the allegory of our warfare, and from thence attaine to the ſcope and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe words, let us now looke upon them both, and ſee how the one keepeth correſpondence with che o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In a carnall and bodily warfare, wee know that three things are chiefly remarkable: 1. The fight. 2. The enemies. 3. The Captaines charge. All of theſe wee ſhall finde here ſet downe unto us in theſe few words, as in a mappe, our ſpirituall warfare: for never did any Generall on earth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipher better the ſeverall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of a pitched battell, then our Redeemer Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus doth here wiſely both ſet us in order of battell, and providently tell us both how to fight, and how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. And that this may bee
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:20885:216"/> cleare, looke to the words, in which hee foundeth to us our alarum, and commandeth us fight: for as it is in the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly combate, ſo is it in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall: in it wee have five things conſiderable. 1. The fight it ſelfe, <hi>temptation.</hi> 2. The enemies, and theſe are all thoſe who have a part in this temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. 3. The ſouldiers, and theſe are wee, who are the children and ſervants of God. 4. The Captaine, God our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who is in heaven. 5. And laſt of all, what is his charge: hee muſt bee our leader: All of theſe packed up from their ſeverall places, make up to us this maine charge, <hi>Lead us not into temptation.</hi> Wee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne now to the firſt thing conſiderable in the words, and that is our fight, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to us in the word, <hi>Temptation:</hi> For the better underſtanding whereof, wee
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:20885:217"/> muſt know that as there is <hi>Multiplex pugnandi genus,</hi> ſo there is <hi>Multiplex tentandige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus:</hi> For, <hi>Aliter pugnatur in ſchola, aliter in praetio:</hi> wee fight one way in the fencing ſchoole, another way in the field. Whilſt wee are in the fencing ſchoole our maſter fighteth againſt us, his ſtrokes are ſoft, and for our inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But when wee come to the field, our enemie fighteth againſt us, his ſtrokes are fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious &amp; deſperate, and his end is to deſtroy us. We have need then to watch over our ſelves &amp; guard our ſelves well, leſt by our negligence &amp; ſecurity we fall and cannot riſe againe. Yet to make the word more cleare, wee muſt labour to diſtinguiſh tempters in their ſeverall ſorts, and from thence know what temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is truly, and what is the nature thereof. For under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:20885:217"/> of which, wee muſt know that there are three ſorts of tempters: God, man, ſathan: God tempteth man: man tempteth man: man tempteth God: ſathan tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth man alſo. God tempteth man, and his temptations are but tryalls of man: not that it is requiſite for God to trie what is in man; for he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth already what is in mans heart, his mouth, workes and wayes. But when God tryeth and tempteth a man, it is to make man knowne to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, &amp; to thoſe with whom hee lives in the world. Thus he tryed and tempted <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> faith, <hi>Iobs</hi> patience, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> love, <hi>Peters</hi> perſeverance, and <hi>Pauls</hi> ſincerity. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> faith, in offering up of <hi>Iſaaek: Iobs</hi> patience, by his multiplyed afflictions: <hi>Davids</hi> love, in <hi>Abſolous</hi> perſecution: <hi>Peters</hi> perſeverance, by a
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:20885:218"/> damoſell, and <hi>Pauls</hi> ſincerity, by a buffer of Sathan. Now as God tempteth man, not for that he is ignorant of what is in man, but that he may make him know himſelfe, &amp; that his graces in man may be knowne to the world, &amp; as the Apoſtle writing to the Corinthia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that they who are approved may bee knowne: ſo alſo in the ſecond place, man tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God: and as God tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth man, and is free of ſinne, ſo man when hee tempteth God is never void of it: for whilſt man tempteth and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God, it is a faithleſſe and diſtruſtfull tryall hee maketh of Gods power. So Iſrael tempted God ſinfully in the wilderneſſe, whilſt by tenne ſeverall te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptations they forced God to make knowne unto them his omnipotencie, and all-ſufficient power. <hi>Can God
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:20885:218"/> prepare a table to us in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe? or can hee give fleſh to the thouſands of Iſrael to eate?</hi> Thirdly, man tempteth man, and that diverſly; for there is a temptation, and a tryall, whereby man tempteth man, approved of in Scripture: and there is a temptation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by man tempteth man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and diſ-allowed in Scripture. Of the firſt ſort of temptations and tryalls are thoſe which man uſeth for clearing of controverſies: As <hi>Salomon</hi> tryed the harlot by her unnaturalneſſe to the child which ſhee claimed. Or then for trying or examining the knowledge and grace of God in man, ſo miniſters are bound in duty to try their flocks, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters their ſervants, &amp; parents their children in the progreſſe and growth of Chriſtianity. Laſtly, Sathan is a tempter, and that a chiefe and maine one:
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:20885:219"/> For as all his temptations are to evill, ſo are they all ſinfull; and that in two reſpects, both in reſpect of himſelfe, and in reſpect of man; for whilſt hee tempteth man to ſinne, hee not onely ſinnes againſt man, but alſo againſt himſelfe: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt man, by drawing him to ſinne againſt God: Againſt himſelfe, by adding to his judgement, for by how much hee drawes many to condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, by ſo much the more ſhall his judgement be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, &amp; his conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated. Now out of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe ſeverall ſorts of te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pters, &amp; te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptations, it is eaſie to know in the generall vvhat temptation is, vvhich is either <hi>probationis,</hi> or <hi>deceptionis:</hi> It is either a tryall, or a deceit: Gods temptations are but try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls of the graces of his Saints. Mans temptations for the moſt part, and Sathans alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:20885:219"/> are deceits, and ſnares laid before us, to intrap, and enſnare us in ſinne and in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. Thus then our exerciſe being in this life nothing elſe but a warfare, in which wee muſt fight againſt the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the devill, whoſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates are the world, and the fleſh, wee have more then need to runne to God, and ſay, <hi>Lead us not into temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thou wilt enquire of me, O man, if by this Petition wee meane any other temptation, then that which is from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than alone: or if here wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precate any other? I anſwer, wee doe by this Petition ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and abſolutely pray againſt the temptations of the devill, the world, and the fleſh, in ſo farre as by them wee are led to ſinne againſt God: wee do alſo pray againſt the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of man, in ſo farre as by them man laboureth to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:20885:220"/> and enſnare us in the way of Gods diſobedience: but as for the temptations of God, wee do not abſolutely pray againſt them, for by them we are oft times ſtrengthened in the way of grace, and made ſtronger and more perfect in the hidden man of our heart: For whilſt God tempteth and tryeth us, it is either in reſpect of himſelfe, or of our ſelves, or of others, or in reſpect of Sathan the devill. In reſpect of himſelfe, when hee tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and tryeth us he bettereth not his knowledge of us, for hee knoweth us better then wee our ſelves: hee knoweth our frame, and our faſhion, for his hands hath faſhioned us below in the earth, and the thoughts of our hearts are not hid from him: but his care in our tryalls is, from them to extract his owne glory. Wee know brethren, by experience,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:20885:220"/> that Cynamon, and the rareſt ſpices, howſoever they bee alwayes fragrant, and odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous, yet do they never ſmell ſo ſweetly, as when they are bruized in the morter of the Apothecary: It is even ſo with us, wee are alwayes pleaſant and acceptable to our God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; but never ſo pleaſant, as when wee are in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of affliction, and under the rod of his correction: for there hee is with us to keepe us, that our buſh conſume not, that our cloathes ſcorch not, and that his ſtrength may bee made perfect in our weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. Secondly, hee tryeth us alſo in reſpect of our ſelves, that we may know what is in us, that if wee ſtand, wee may give God the glory, and if wee fall, we may know our owne weakneſſe. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> was a choſen veſſell
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:20885:221"/> of mercy, and yet but a man, and to the end that hee might not bee puft up, there was an Angell of Sathan ſent to buffet him. <hi>Peter</hi> was a choſen veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of mercy alſo, yet that hee might know himſelfe, God left him to himſelfe, and hee fell foully. <hi>Sampſon</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> were both men approved of God, yet that they might bee knowne to themſelves, they were left of God for a while, and by their fall learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to know, that without the continuall aſſiſtance of Gods grace, they were but <hi>exuviae hominum,</hi> the out ſides of men, for woe befell them when God departed from them. Thirdly, in reſpect of others, God tempteth us alſo, and that for their inſtruction, and our imitation. For as it is with the teacher of a lyon, who taketh a dogge and whips him before him, that by the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:20885:221"/> and howling of the dog, the lyon may learne to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and feare the rod: So doth God with his Saints: hee correcteth, tempteth, and tryeth one, that all the reſt may ſtand in awe and feare. Why was it, I pray you, that hee turned <hi>Lots</hi> wife into a pillar of ſalt, but that hee might by her example teach us, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t nos ejus couderet exemplo?</hi> Why left he <hi>Noah, Lot, David, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> and <hi>Samvſon</hi> to have frailties, but that by their example, hee might teach us to tread out the footſteps of their ſalvation in feare and trembling: and that whilſt wee thinke wee ſtand, wee may take heede that wee fall not. Laſtly, God tempteth us in reſpect of the Devill, and that for two cauſes: Firſt, to ſatisfie his importunity. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to ſtop his mouth, and rubbe ſhame on his face.
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:20885:222"/> To ſatisfie his importunity: for hee goeth about continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally like a roaring lyon, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how hee may devour us. Thus hee dealt with <hi>Peter</hi> ſeeking to winnow him like wheate. Thus with <hi>Iob: Doth Iob ſerve God for nothing?</hi> No, like that unjuſt Judge in the Goſpell, who for importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty gave eare to the widow: So Sathan is alwayes impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, and many times there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſpeedeth and prevaileth Sometime againe, God ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Sathan to runne looſe at his Saints to rub ſhame on his face: that by their pereve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and grace, or recovery from their falls by repentance hee may ſtop Sathans mouth, and ſay of all his Saints, what he ſaid once of <hi>Iob:</hi> Haſt thou not conſidered my ſervant <hi>Iob,</hi> who yet continueth in his uprightneſſe though thou haſt moved mee to correct him
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:20885:222"/> without a cauſe? And as hee ſaid to the Apoſtle S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, My grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> Now in all theſe reſpects, wee have reaſon to ſay, <hi>Lead us not into temptation:</hi> yet ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and abſolutely, in reſpect of none but Sathan.</p>

               <p>IN our laſt ſermon delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on theſe words, it was told you that this Petition had two parts: the firſt depreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory or a praying againſt temptation. The ſecond ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatory: wherein we beg'd of God grace, that we be not overcome of them. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the firſt, we ſhewed you, that foure things were chiefly
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:20885:223"/> conſiderable. Firſt, the fight, in our temptation: Secondly, our adverſaries againſt whom we have to fight. Thirdly, our fellow ſouldiers. Fourthly, our head and leader. Of the firſt of theſe I ſpake in our laſt Sermon: It reſteth now that wee come to ſpeake of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing conſiderable in theſe words: to wit, who are our enemies, and adverſaries, againſt whom God leadeth us out to fight. Now if any ſhall aske againſt whom it is that the Chriſtian is ſent to battell; The Apoſtle anſwereth for us, telling us, that wee fight not againſt fleſh and blood, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt principalities and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, &amp;c. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. In a word, hee doth there inſinuate unto us that our enemies are the world, the fleſh, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. I will not at this time intreat of theſe three adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of mans ſalvation, for
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:20885:223"/> time will not ſuffer mee to paint them out to the life: yea I know how many large vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes have beene publiſhed already on this ſubject, by worthy and learned men: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the by as it were, and in ſo farre, as the vvords here ſhall offer us occaſion, I will point at them: and from their weake conſiderations ſpeake ſome words of comfort and inſtruction to your ſoules. It is certaine that the chiefe and arch enemy of mans ſalvation is Sathan the devill, who: hath beene a lyer to man, and a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer of man from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. But becauſe he is a ſpirit &amp; therefore inviſible that man cannot know him whilſt hee fights with him, he ſuborneth two ſouldiers againſt man: the world from without man: the fleſh, the luſts thereof within man: that man having fightings within, &amp; terrors without, may
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:20885:224"/> fall and never riſe againe. But that I may make you ſenfible of theſe his aſſaults and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, know that whilſt I ſpeak of the world, I do not underſtand this great and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſticke frame of the world compoſed of theſe foure ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, fire, aire, earth, and water: for by theſe man is not tempted, all, and every one of theſe Sathan hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to puniſh man for ſin: but by none of theſe hath hee at any time tempted man for ſinne: But by the world I underſtand the children of diſobedience, and wicked ones that are in the vvorld: and that not ſimply or abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, as they are fleſh of our fleſh, and bone of our bones, but conditionally, and as they are either cloathed with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and wealth, or elſe as they are ſtripped naked in the day of their want and miſery.
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:20885:224"/> And that the wicked of the world are called of God, the world, it is cleare out of that prayer of our Saviour Chriſt, whilſt hee ſaith, <hi>I pray not for the world, but for thoſe whom thou haſt given mee out of the world.</hi> Now theſe as they ſtand either inveſted or cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with proſperity, or ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped naked with calamity, and want, do prove a ſtumbling blocke and ſnare, or tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the children of God. For in the day of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, by their carnall joy wherewith they are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in their pleaſures: by their carnall ſecurity, whereby they cry peace to themſelves, when God mindeth them no peace: and by their proud trampling upon the weake, and deſpiſing of them that want; what do they but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite us to runne with them in the exceſſe of their riot, and
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:20885:225"/> by their temporall felicities labour to draw away (if it were poſſible) the very elect of God, from the ſearch and purchaſe of that felicity which is immortall and undefiled? Againe, in the day of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, what do they but cry to us with <hi>Iobs</hi> wife, <hi>Curſe God and die.</hi> With <hi>Iehoram, I will wait no longer on the Lords lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi> And with Iſrael in the wilderneſſe, <hi>Would God wee had dyed by the fleſh pots of Egypt.</hi> But brethren, vvith theſe things let us not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, let neither the proſperity of the vvicked draw thee to a carnall rejoycing or love of the vvorld; for the proſperity of the vvicked is but like cracking of thornes under a pot: nor let the calamity of the godly (vvho ſuffer juſtly for their ſinnes) dravv thee to apoſtacie and back-ſliding from the faith: for it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:20885:225"/> to ſuffer affliction with the children of God, then to enjoy the periſhing pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. And it is more honourable for us to imbrace the Croſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, then all the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of a corrupt and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Egypt. Againe, Sathan in the ſecond place, hireth our fleſh to fight againſt us; and here by the word fleſh, I do not underſtand this body of ours alone, which is compoſed of fleſh &amp; blood, but alſo that naturall corruption which we have drawne from the loynes of our firſt parents, who have infected us both ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and dwelling in us fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth deſperately, and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly againſt us: This corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Scripture expreſſeth by many names and titles: as <hi>The old man: The old Adam: The naturall man: The law of our members:</hi> and <hi>The luſts of
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:20885:226"/> the fleſh, which fight againſt the ſoule.</hi> Thus wee ſee, that the fleſh is alſo our enemy, and ſo much the more odious, by how much it is traiterous. For of it wee may ſay what <hi>David</hi> ſaid in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 41. <hi>My familiar friend whom I truſted, and hee that lay in my boſome, and did eate bread with mee, hath lifted up his heele againſt mee.</hi> To this <hi>Iudas</hi> who betrayeth us, wee may juſtly ſay, <hi>It were good for thee thou hadſt never bin borne.</hi> To this <hi>Dalilah,</hi> wee may ſay, <hi>If thou hadſt not plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with my heyfer, thou couldſt not have read my riddle.</hi> To this wife of <hi>Iob,</hi> wee may ſay, <hi>Thou ſpeakeſt like a fooliſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> And laſtly, to this unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed counſeller wee may juſtly ſay, <hi>Get thee behinde mee Sathan,</hi> for thou knoweſt not the things that are of God, but the things that are of man. Now wouldſt thou know,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:20885:226"/> O man, why thou ſhouldſt ſo encounter thy fleſh: I anſwer, becauſe it is thy deadly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and that in three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects: In reſpect of malice, of power, and policy. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of malice, for it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>In mee, that is, in my fleſh, there dwelieth no good. Rom.</hi> 7.18. Now that wherein there is no good, muſt of neceſſity bee exceedingly malicious, and fully repleniſhed with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. <hi>Tucaro</hi> (ſaith a Father) <hi>cunctis virtutibus denudata es, &amp; ideo diceris caro a carendo, quia cares omni bono.</hi> And would you have a true anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the fleſh? looke to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 3. <hi>Her eyes are full of adultery, her throat an open ſepulcher, her mouth the mouth of deceit, the poyſon of aſpes is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her lips, her feet are ſwift to ſhed blood, deſtruction and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity are in her wayes, and the way of the Lord ſhee hath not
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:20885:227"/> knowne.</hi> Secondly, the fleſh is a powerfull enemy, both in reſpect of the unregenerate, and alſo in reſpect of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate. In the unregenerate it is a mighty King: in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate it is a cruell tyrant. In the unregenerate, I ſay, it is a mighty king: for as a King in his kingdome ſwayes the ſcepter, enacteth lawes, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth obedience, and ſubdueth rebells: So is it in the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man; ſinne beareth do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, giveth a law to the members, and leadeth all the affections captive to diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And from this it is that the Apoſtle exhorteth us not to ſuffer ſinne to raigne in our mortall bodies. And as the fleſh is a King in the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, ſo in the regenerate it is a cruell tyrant: for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever by the grace of God in Jeſus Chriſt, wee are ſet free from the law of Sinne, and
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:20885:227"/> of death, yet ſo long as wee dwell in the body, it dwelleth in us, and both tormenteth us with the torture of a wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſcience, for ſinne paſt, &amp; with continuall moleſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſinne in time to come. So that the beſt of Gods Saints have deeply ſighed and groaned under the yoke and bondage thereof. <hi>David</hi> could ſay, <hi>I dwell too long in the valley of Meſeck, and in tents of Kedar.</hi> And the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay, <hi>O miſerable man that I am, who ſhall deliver mee from this body of death?</hi> Finally, the fleſh is an enemy excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly politique, for howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the power of the fleſh be great, yet the policie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is greater: becauſe it is not a publique enemy, but a home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and domeſtique traitor, therfore by the ſubtile ſleight, &amp; cunning undermining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, many times we fall, and are
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:20885:228"/> overthrowne: From hence it is that the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> forewarneth us of the policy thereof, whilſt hee ſaith, <hi>The heart of man is deſperately wicked, and deceitfull above all things, none can know it but the Lord that made it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wouldſt thou know and try this? O man, go home to thy heart and ſee how it dealeth with thee. The world is a great temptation, and a great tempter. Sathan alſo hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny temptations, and is an arch tempter: but what can the temptations of the world do to thee? or what can all the temptations of the devill do againſt thee, except thy owne heart, and thy owne fleſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and betray thee? for as Sathan ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Caſt thy ſelfe downe, &amp;c.</hi> and as <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ieſabel, Who is there on our ſide? &amp;c.</hi> ſo doth Sathan ſay to man, whilſt by the fleſh
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:20885:228"/> hee tempteth him; except wee caſt our ſelves downe, except the fleſh be on his ſide within us, neither proſperity, nor adverſity, famine, nor na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, life nor death, can ever prejudice us. But if in theſe baits hee can hire our owne fleſh againſt us, wee are eaſily overcome: and like an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>Aza,</hi> hyring a <hi>Benha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad</hi> againſt us, Iſrael getteth the foile, and the beſt trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Gods houſe are but a prey to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</label> Thus having deciphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our inbred enemy, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth us carefully to watch over it: for the ſpirit may well bee ready, but the fleſh is weake. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deale with this our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall adverſary, as the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of a beſieged city do with their inbred traitors: if any city were beſieged with forraigne forces, and they
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:20885:229"/> knew that they harboured a traitor within their boſome, they would give no reſt to their eye-lids, nor ſlumber to their eyes till they ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, diſarme, condemne, and put him to death: So is it with us, our citadell the ſoule is beſieged by a fierce and for raigne enemy; wee have a traitor lurking in our boſome, our owne fleſh: Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with all ſpeed riſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, diſarme it by faſting and prayer, let us beate it downe, and bring it in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and let us mortifie the luſts thereof by the ſpirit, and wee ſhall be ſure that God ſhall ſhortly tread it under foot, and give us the victory: for it is written, <hi>The elder ſhall ſerve the younger.</hi> The laſt enemy we have to fight againſt is the Devill, a chiefe and arch enemy: for he goeth about co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſeeking how hee may
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:20885:229"/> devour us. No time can free us from his temptation, the morning, the noonetide of the day, or the midnight of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. No place, not the throne of judgment, nor the ſtreet of our trade, nor the cabinet where wee reſt. No perſon alſo is free from him: he ſpared not the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> nor did hee ſpare the ſecond <hi>Adam:</hi> How are the ſonnes of the firſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> according to the fleſh, and the ſonnes of the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> according to the ſpirit, free from his aſſaults? No ſurely, wee may not, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be free from them.</p>
               <p>But wouldſt thou know, O man, the manner of his fight: Know that the temptations of Sathan have three gradations, even the ſame which every voluntary action of man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or bad, hath in it. For in the ſoule of man there are 3 faculties, one ſenſitive,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:20885:230"/> another appetitive, the third locomotive. And the actions of theſe three faculties are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly three, ſenſe, appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, motion. For firſt, a man ſees or heares an object pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to his eyes or eares; the ſenſe repreſenteth the object to our appetite or delight: the delight or will, either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth or refuſeth the object, and this wee call the motion. Now as it is in every action, ſo is it in the temptations of Sathan, for firſt hee bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſenſe: ſecondly, hee inflameth the appetite: and thirdly, hee procureth the action. Would wee have this made more cleare? I will. Looke on <hi>David,</hi> when hee fell in adultery, how playd Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than the ſouldier with him? Hee firſt faſcined or bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſenſe: for it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Hee ſaw a woman waſhing her ſelfe, and the woman was
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:20885:230"/> beautifull:</hi> Secondly, inflamed his delight, for it is written, <hi>Hee ſent meſſengers, and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after the woman, and ſhee came in unto him.</hi> Thirdly, by both of theſe, and from both of theſe hee procureth and propagateth the action, for it is written, <hi>And hee lay with her.</hi> Againe, if this one exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſufficeth not, behold ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>When the woman ſaw that the fruit was pleaſant to the eyes, and a tree to bee deſired to make one wiſe, ſhee tooke of the fruit, and did eate.</hi> Behold here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a third: It is confeſſed by <hi>Achan:</hi> when hee ſaw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ſpoyles a goodly Babiloniſh garment, and a wedge of gold of fifty ſhickles, then I coveted them and tooke them. Theſe three then, <hi>ſenſe, deſire,</hi> and <hi>motion,</hi> as they are in every action, ſo they are in every temptation: For Sathan in his temptations
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:20885:231"/> firſt beſiegeth our ſenſes, and ſeeing they are the gates of the ſoule, theſe being opened, hee windes himſelfe into our delight and appetite, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, ſhall wee thinke that he who hath taken paines to gather ſo many ſtickes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, will not take paines to blow a fire to warme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe? No, no, hee is an angell of darkneſſe, but there hee transformeth himſelfe into an angell of light: there he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth evill of Good, and good of evill, and there hee putteth bitter for ſweete, and ſweet for ſowre. Laſt of all, when by the abuſe of our ſenſes hee hath captivated our affections, thinkeſt thou that hee will leave that fire which hee hath blown ſo much, untill it burn? No, no, I tell thee he will not leave it, till it burſt forth in a flame, and till thou burne in the midſt of it. Will the
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:20885:231"/> husbandman, when hee caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his ſeede in the ground, fall too and plow up the ground againe, without hope of harveſt? No ſurely, in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience hee will wait for it, and firſt let it come to a blade, then to a ſtalke, then to an eare, then to be ripened, and laſt of all hee cutteth it downe and bringeth it into his barne. I will aſſure thee, it is ſo with Sathan: for though hee bee not a husbandman, yet hee is an envious man, and whilſt the husbandman ſleepeth hee ſoweth tares amongſt the wheat. And though he ſeeme to miſ-know it, yet is not he careleſſe of it, but by all meanes hee watereth it with the ſtolne waters of pleaſure, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till hee bring it to harveſt and maturity. Hee can ſay to the young man, <hi>Rejoyce O yong man in thy youth and let thy heart cheere thee in thy young
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:20885:232"/> dayes.</hi> Hee can ſay to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous man, Pull downe thy barnes and make them more large, and then cry a peace to thy ſoule. Hee can ſay to the furious man, Smite him at once, that thou may not ſmite him the ſecond time. And <hi>What thou doſt do quickly.</hi> And in a word, whatſoever ſeed of iniquity, or bitter root of corruption hee ſoweth or planteth in our hearts, this is his policy, hee firſt bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſenſe, then enflameth the appetite or deſire: and laſt of all, he bringeth ſinne to accompliſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</label> In reſpect hereof, it becommeth us carefully to watch over our ſenſes, as the gates and dores of our ſoules. Secondly, to keepe a guard about our affections, that though our ſenſes be infected, yet our hearts be not affected. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139. And laſt of all, wee
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:20885:232"/> ſhould be earneſt and carefull to mortifie both of theſe, leaſt their infection prevayling, ſin in thee come to a maturity, and thou reape as thou haſt ſowne: for hee that ſoweth to the fleſh ſhall of the fleſh reape corruption, and hee that ſoweth to the ſpirit, ſhall of the ſpirit reape life and glory, and honor, and life &amp; immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. Thus whilſt wee ſeeke to bee free from temptations, wee ſeek to be freed from the temptations of the devill, the world, and the fleſh. And if God at any time ſhall ſuffer us to fall into theſe temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, wee then begge of him, that wee may not bee overcome of them. <hi>Non enim petimus ut non tentemur, ſed ut a tentatione non vincamur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now followeth the third thing remarkable in the words, and that is, who are the ſouldiers that muſt fight
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:20885:233"/> the battell. To this I anſwer, all thoſe that are ſubject to temptation: the whole have no neede of the phyſitian, but the ſicke: if any man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thinke himſelf free from the dint of temptation, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to ſay, <hi>Lead us not into temptation:</hi> but if none can exempt himſelfe, then what I ſay to one I ſay to all, <hi>Watch and pray that yee enter not into temptation.</hi> But that I may ſpeake more clearely. The ſouldiers of this Chriſtian warfare, are all thoſe who are members of the myſticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus. To what end elſe hath hee clothed them with his livory; put his badge on them, given them their earneſt, and covered them under his banner? hee hath clothed us with his livory, whilſt he hath imputed to us his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; hee hath put his badge on us, whilſt hee hath bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:20885:233"/> us in his name: hee hath given us earneſt, whilſt hee hath given us the firſt fruits of the Spirit to dwell in us, and hee hath convocated us under his banner, whilſt hee calleth to bee within the pale and precinct of his Church. But this is not all: thou wilt enquire yet who are thoſe to whom hee hath concredited theſe endowments. I anſwer, the Saints militant and tryum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant. By the Saints militant, I underſtand men and women on earth. By the Saints try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant, I underſtand thoſe who fought the fight, finiſhed their courſe, and now are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into their maſters joy. But here two queſtions may ariſe: the firſt is this: Have none beene tempted but the ſonnes and daughters of men? I anſwer, none: for howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be true, that Jeſus Chriſt was the Sonne of God, yet
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:20885:234"/> as the ſonne of man hee was alſo tempted with us, and that for theſe foure cauſes. Firſt, <hi>Ad cautelam.</hi> 2. <hi>In auxilium.</hi> 3. <hi>Ad exemplum</hi> 4. <hi>In fiduciam.</hi> The ſonne of God was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in our fleſh, for our cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and for warning ſake, that looking on him, no man might thinke himſelfe ſet free from temptation: for if hee hath not ſpared the Cedar of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon, how ſhall hee ſpare us poore Iſop buſhes? Secondly, hee was tempted for our aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and aid, for what ſhall it availe a man to know that his enemy approacheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, unleſſe hee be able to reſiſt him: therefore Chriſt came, and in our fleſh was tempted alſo, that hee might deliver us in all our temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, both from the feare of death, and from him who had the power of death, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. Thirdly, hee was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:20885:234"/> for our example, for as hee ſaid of himſelfe: learne of me, for I am mecke and lowly: and as the Evangeliſt S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith of his waſhing of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples feet: I have given you an example, that you ſhould do one to another as I have done to you. So alſo hath hee ſuffered our temptations, and was tempted like unto us, that hee might leave us an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to follow his foot ſteps. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. Fourthly, hee was tempted for our comfort and aſſurance of victory, for it is written, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Wee have not ſuch an High Prieſt as cannot be touched with our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, but hee was tempted in all things like unto us,</hi> yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne. Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, and wee ſhall finde grace, to helpe us in the time of need. The ſecond queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is this, Who are thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:20885:235"/> the ſonnes and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of men, who can truly ſay that they are tempted? to this I anſwer: If tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be a fight, thoſe onely are truly ſaid to be tempted, who do bravely &amp; couragiouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt and fight againſt their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary. It is not the ſluggard that lyeth down to ſleepe: nor the coward that ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth away: nor the feeble hearted that yeeldeth that can truly be called the ſouldies of God, but they only who hold faſt what they have received: who ſtand faſt within the liberty wherewith they are made free; and who continue conſtant unto the end, that as the good ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Jeſus Chriſt ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the crowne. Seeing then amongſt the ſonnes of men, there are ſome who are in the gall of bitterneſſe, who are taken captive of Sathan at his will, who are given over to
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:20885:235"/> their vile affections, and to the power of error <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Sure I am, theſe are not worthy of the title of this fight, nor to have their names billeted for the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of Jeſus: onely they then in whom though ſinne dwell, yet doth not raigne, are the true ſoldiers of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus: who can with <hi>Abraham</hi> refuſe to be enriched from So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: and with <hi>Moſes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to leave a howfe behind him, are worthy: and ſhall be clothed in white, and receive a white ſtone, and in it a new name which no man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but hee that poſſeſſeth it.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</label> Now what ſhall I ſay concerning man, the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſouldier, and the neceſſity of his reſiſtance? Alas there is ſo much in man enemy to man, and ſo little left in him, that is able to reſiſt or fight for him, much leſſe to triumph,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:20885:236"/> and conquer or ſubdue his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to him, I thinke; I can onely intreat man to looke continually on his captaine. And yet becauſe hee muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fight or elſe never try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, there are two things of which I would advertiſe him. Firſt let him not thruſt himſelfe into temptation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>There be a cauſe;</hi> And that with Jeſus hee bee led with the ſpirit. For our adverſaries are many, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious, powerfull, and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick: And like the ſons of <hi>Zer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viah, too mighty for us,</hi> unleſſe that hee who commandeth us to fight, fight in us and for us, wee cannot be victorious. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when hee is called to battell, let him not bee a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for hee hath more then good company, his God for a Captaine watching over him: his Redeemer his elder brother fighting for him: the
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:20885:236"/> holy Ghoſt his comforter fighting in him: his fellow brethren ſtanding on his one hand, and all the Angels of heaven on the other: and who would not fight with ſo good company? No, no my brethren, let us lift up our faint hearts, and ſtrengthen our weake knees: though the conflict be hard, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt is honourable: for God will ſhortly tread Sathan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our feet, through Jeſus Chriſt out Lord. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>ACcording to the tenor of of our firſt propoſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod wee have already ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto you of the firſt three things that were remarkable in this Petition, to wit, of our
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:20885:237"/> calling, temptation; of our enemies, the world, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and the fleſh; And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of our fellow ſouldiers, Jeſus. Chriſt in the dayes of his fleſh: our fellow bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren now Saints in heaven, and our fellow brethren here militant on earth; It reſteth now that wee conſider and ponder aright the fourth and laſt thing remarkable in them: to wit, who is our Leader, and it is God, for to him, and to him alone it is that we put up ſupplication, and ſay, <hi>Lead us not into temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in handling of this point, three things are chiefly remarkable: Firſt, who it is that is our Leader, and why it is that hee is ſo called. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, how it is that hee leads us into temptation. And thirdly, whilſt hee leads us into temptation, whether hee be guilty of ſinne or no? The
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:20885:237"/> firſt thing obſervable is, Who is our leader; I anſwer, God, and that very God, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one in eſſence, is three in perſons, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt: God the Father is our leader, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee is called the Lord of Hoſts. God the Sonne is our leader, and therefore tooke upon him our fleſh, that in it, hee being firſt a ſouldier, might thereafter become our leader. Finally, God the holy Ghoſt is now by deputation become our leader, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is written, <hi>That as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as are led by the Spirit, are the Sonnes of God.</hi> God the Father is our leader, and for that cauſe is ſtiled the Lord of Hoſts: <hi>Dominus exercituum,</hi> this is his name for ever, and this is his memoriall unto all ages Of all the titles that God hath in ſcripture, there is not one ſo often uſed by
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:20885:238"/> God himſelfe as this: For ſhall wee looke but upon two Prophets, <hi>Iſayah</hi> and <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> and in them alone this title is attributed to God above an hundred &amp; thirty times. It is not a title then likely to bee looked upon, but with deepe and due conſideration: let us then looke upon it. Our lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God is called the Lord of hoſtes in theſe reſpects: firſt in reſpect of the generall frame of all his creatures, who being viewed and conſidered in a maſſe together, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a pitched field, and a battell ſet in aray, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the honour of God, and the obedience that is due unto him: For in the heaven of heavens, there is an hoſt of bleſſed Angels covering their faces and bowing their knees before his Throne, ſinging a deepe <hi>Halleluiah,</hi> and caſting their crownes downe at his
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:20885:238"/> feet: And this company is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an hoſt: for <hi>Luke</hi> 2. whilſt they appeared to the ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards at the birth of Chriſt, it is written of them: <hi>There was a multitude of Angels, and an heavenly hoſt, praiſing God, and ſaying, Glory be to God on high, and to men on earth peace and goodwill.</hi> Let us from that place looke a little lower, and behold the ſtarry firmament, that is above our heads, and there wee ſhall finde that hee is the Lord of hoſts alſo, for there the Sunne, moone and Starres are his ſouldiers, they fight for him, and againſt his enemies: as it is cleare out of the hiſtory of <hi>Ioſhuah,</hi> and <hi>Iudges:</hi> and of theſe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſayah</hi> ſaith, 45.12. ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of God, <hi>I, even I, have ſtretched out the heavens, and their hoſt I have commanded:</hi> but let us come a little lower, and looke to the cattle that walke,

<pb n="461" facs="tcp:20885:239"/> of a ſtranger, is the revenger of the quarrell of Gods cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Thirdly, will wee looke on theſe our native, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticke armies of fleſh, that are in theſe our mortall bodies, I meane the ague, the webbe in the eye, the paine in the tooth, the conſumption of the lungs, the ſhortneſſe of the breath, the ſtone in the reines, the tympany of the belly, and the gout in the feet, what are all theſe, but the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God, and hoſt of the Almighty, fighting in man, againſt man, becauſe man hath fought againſt God, who was his leader? Laſt of all, hee is Lord of hoſts alſo in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſenſe: for he is our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and leader in our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall warfare, againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, the world, and the luſts of our owne fleſh: For it is by him, and by his grace alone; that wee have either courage
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:20885:240"/> to encounter, ſtrength to ſtand faſt, or patience to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere unto the end. And as in this hee is our leader and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, ſo doth he alſo hold the reines of our enemies cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots: it was hee that made the wheeles of <hi>Pharoes</hi> cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots to fall off. It was he that threw the ſtone at the fore-head of <hi>Goliah:</hi> It was hee that ſmote the Philiſtines with the jawbone of an Aſſe. It was hee that thruſt the dart through <hi>Achabs</hi> brigandine: and it was he alone that put a bridle in the lips of <hi>Zenacharih,</hi> and a hooke in his noſtrels: and finally it is hee, and hee alone, who for our ſakes by death hath deſtroyed him who hath the power of death, that is, the devill; and hath put into our mouth that tryum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant ſong of victory, <hi>O death where is thy ſting, O grave where is thy victory? Bleſſed be
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:20885:240"/> God the Father through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, in all theſe things we are more then Conquerers,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our leader hath loved us with a love unſpeakable in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. In this manner then is God the Father our leader, yet not hee alone: as hee is the Father, this his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority hee hath given and derived from him to his Son, our Redeemer, according as it is written, <hi>All power is given mee both in heaven and in earth.</hi> And that we may know more perfectly how our Redeemer Jeſus is become our leader, look I pray you on the ſeverall parts &amp; periods of his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp; authority given unto him in our fleſh, and for our ſake: for it was either preor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained before time, proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in time, or ſhall be perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted after all time, when time ſhall be no more. Before time, he was preordained to be our
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:20885:241"/> leader: for it is not only writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that in him it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Father before the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the world were laid, to chuſe us to be heires of glory: But alſo it was told by the Apoſtle S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> that of all his ſufferings, nothing did befall him, but that which was preordained to befall him by the ſecret counſell and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall purpoſe of God. Hee was alſo ſent in time to be our lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and that in many ſeverall points of accompliſhment: for firſt hee is promiſed, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prefigured, thirdly that the prefiguration might bee made relative to the promiſe, the promiſe is reiterated; fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, leſt man ſhould have fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under the expectation of the promiſe, hee is ſent in the fulneſſe of time. Firſt, hee was promiſed to bee our lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Captaine, in Paradiſe, <hi>I will put an emnity betwixt thy
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:20885:241"/> ſeed, and the ſeed of the woman, he ſhall bruiſe thy head, but thou ſhalt bruiſe his heele.</hi> Secondly; as hee was promiſed, ſo hee was as alſo prefigured to bee our Captaine. And though by many prefigurations, yet by none more lively, then by thoſe of <hi>Phares</hi> and <hi>Zares: Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Iſaack: Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau:</hi> Of all which, it may bee truly ſaid, <hi>The elder ſhall ſerve the yonger.</hi> Thirdly, as hee was prefigured, ſo alſo was the prefiguration ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened by a new promiſe, for to this effect was it ſaid. <hi>The branch of David, the ſtemme of leſſe, the ſonne of a virgin, and the Emanuel of God,</hi> promiſed under the Law by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Fourthly, leſt the faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hearts of men ſhould have periſhed under the weight of their expectation, in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of time hee was ſent in our fleſh, firſt to play the part
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:20885:242"/> of a ſouldier in himſelfe, and then to become a leader, and Captaine to us. That in the dayes of his fleſh hee was a ſouldier, it is cleare; for it is written, <hi>Hee offered up ſtrong cryes and ſupplications, and was heard in that which hee feared.</hi> That in his aſcentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he became our Captaine; it is ſure alſo: for it is written, <hi>Hee led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity captive, and gave gifts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men.</hi> Finally, that in the end of time, hee ſhall bee our Captaine and leader, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt alſo, in that which is written, <hi>When hee had ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Now as this relation is founded in the perſon of the Father, and from him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived unto the Sonne, So alſo from them both by way of
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:20885:242"/> 
                  <hi>Economy,</hi> it is derived unto the Holy Ghoſt: for it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>So many as are lead by the Spirit of God, are the Sonnes of God.</hi> And againe, <hi>It is expedient that I goe from you to the Father, for unleſſe I goe to the Father, the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall not come to you. But when I ſhall ſend the Comforter from the Father unto you, hee ſhall lead you in all truth, and comfort you in all your adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> But that his authority, and government may bee the better felt of us, learne I pray you to know, that the alligory of his government is fitting to command mans obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, either as hee is a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim, or as hee is a ſouldier: for whether hee lead us as pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, in an unknowne way, or as weake ſouldiers in our hard conflict, his operations to us, and in us are threefold. For he leadeth us <hi>Monendo,
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:20885:243"/> movendo, &amp; removende:</hi> that is to ſay, he forewarneth us, hee incourageth us, and hee remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth ſomething from us. If wee looke on our ſelves as pilgrims, and ſo hee firſt fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warneth us of the difficulties of the way: for it is written, <hi>Strait and narrow is the way, that leadeth unto life, and few there bee that enter in thereat.</hi> Againe, <hi>Through manifold tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations we muſt enter into the Kingdome of God.</hi> And as hee forewarneth us, ſo alſo hee leadeth us by moving us, for hee not onely calleth upon us, <hi>Come unto mee all yee that are weary and heavy laden, and I will eaſe you:</hi> But alſo when wee fall, hee lifteth us up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and whom hee loveth hee loveth to the end, and whom hee once taketh by the hand, none can take them out againe. Finally hee removeth the impediments of our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:20885:243"/> out of the way, for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he ſuffer us to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a while, yet with the temptation hee giveth us the iſſue, that wee may beare it. Againe, if wee looke on our ſelves as ſouldiers, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

Finally, hee removeth our adverſaries from us: for howſoever for our triall and exerciſe, he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer us to bee hardly aſſaulted for a while, yet in the end hee treadeth Sathan under foot, and crowneth our ſoules, not onely with victory, but alſo

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</label> Now then ſeeing God the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt are our leaders, both in our pilgrimage, and ſpirituall conflict, it ſhould both humble and comfort us: humble us in that wee cannot walke without a guide; <hi>Noah</hi> was ſtronger then wee, but when hee forgot his guide, he fell. <hi>Sampſon</hi> was ſtronger then wee, but when hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke his guide, hee fell. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> was wiſer then wee but when hee forſooke his guide, he fell. <hi>David</hi> was holier then wee, but forſaking his guide, hee fell. <hi>Peter</hi> was more ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt then wee, and yet forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his guide, hee fell, <hi>Iſrael</hi> was a people elected and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen beyond and before us, but becauſe they forgot the guide of their youth, therefore they were left to themſelves, to do the things that were not
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:20885:244"/> convenient, and received ſuch recompence of their errour, as was meet.</p>
               <p>It becommeth all of us therefore, whilſt wee thinke that wee ſtand, to take heed that wee fall not. And to ſay to God, as the Eunuch ſaid to <hi>Philip, How can I underſtand without a guide?</hi> Send out therefore, O Lord, the light of thy truth, and let thy good ſpirit lead us into the land of thy righteouſneſſe. Againe, as this ſhould humble us, ſo ſhould it alſo comfort us in the day of our ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all conflict. For as the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Iſraell were ordered in the wilderneſſe, ſo ſhould our marches be ordered here on earth. When they were to march by day, the Lord went before them, in the piller of a cloud, and by night in a piller of fire. When they marched, it was ſaid, <hi>Ariſe,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:20885:245"/> O God, and let thine enemier be confounded.</hi> And when they reſted, it was ſaid, <hi>Returne, O Lord to the thouſands of Iſrael.</hi> Their walke was long, their journey was weariſome, but this comforted them, that they had a good leader. It is even ſo withus: wee are brought bleſſed bee God, from the bondage of an oppreſſing <hi>Pharo,</hi> and a turmoiling Egypt, where our way is thorny, and our adverſaries are many, and ſurely, unleſſe our eyes were towards our leader, there ſhould bee no more ſpirit left in us. But this is our comfort in which we ſhould alwayes joy, and continually rejoyce, that our God the Lord of Hoſts is our leader. That our Redeemer Chriſt Jeſus hath beene our fellow ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, and is now our Captaine; And that the holy Ghoſt the Comforter is our Generall,
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:20885:245"/> and goeth out and in before us, and fighteth in us, and for us. Why ſhould not wee then ſubmit our ſelves to this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment? The world is led by another ſpirit: for the ſpirit that dwelleth in us, luſteth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter envy. But bleſſed is the man who is led by God, and his good Spirit: for whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver are led by the Spirit of God, are the Sonnes of God, and if wee be ſonnes, then alſo ſhall wee bee heires, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low heires with Jeſus Chriſt, and made partakers of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But now my brethren pardon mee, for I have ſpent a great deale of time in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you who is your lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>The ſecond queſtion is, how he can lead us into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. The anſwer hereof ariſeth from the word by which our government and leading is repreſented to us.
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:20885:246"/> For it is thus in the originall <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>, which ſignifieth to lead: but the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of compoſition added, and prefixed to it altereth the ſignification thereof very much. The firſt particle <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth <hi>in.</hi> So that whilſt this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuduction and government in the day of ſpirituall combate of a Chriſtian is attributed to God, it importeth three things unto us from the word it ſelfe. Firſt a leading into temptation. Secondly, a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in temptation. Thirdly, upon the which from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of his goodneſſe, muſt
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:20885:246"/> follow a leading out againe, according to that which is written, <hi>Hee ſuffereth us not to bee tempted above our power, but with the temptation, hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us the iſſue, that wee may be able to beare it.</hi> The firſt part of this conduct is ſafe: the ſecond is gracious: the third is glorious; without the aſſured ſupport and preſence of God, theſe three are like the waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> turned bitter: or like the potage of the children of the Prophets, <hi>There is death in the pot.</hi> For if man or Sathan lead to tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is doubtfull; if they ſhall lead into temptation it is dangerous: and if they cannot lead out of temptation, it is deſperate. Oppoſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the weakneſſe of man to the ſtrength of God, and the malice of Sathan to the love of God, it cannot but bee well ſaid by man to God, <hi>Lead us
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:20885:247"/> not into temptation,</hi> not depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating any part of the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, but his deſertion in the verbe. To cleare this; know that to lead a man into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is ſafe: for this cauſe S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>My brothren, count it for exceeding joy, when you fall into diverſe temptations:</hi> for this is onely to preſent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>object of temptation to man, or to lead man to encounter with an object of temptation. Againſt this we do not al waies pray, for it is ſafe &amp; good for us ſo to be exerciſed at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, it maketh us watch over our ſenſes to make a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with our eyes, and with <hi>David</hi> to pray, <hi>Lord turne away mine eies from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding vanity.</hi> To lead a man into temptation is gracious: for as meat is to the hungry, or drinke to the thirſty, or light to the priſoner; ſo is helpe and ſupport to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>batant. What
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:20885:247"/> other comfort I pray you had <hi>David</hi> in his conflict with <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> then this, that God was with him in his temptation? I come not againſt thee in mine owne name, but in the name of the Lord of Hoſts, who delivered into my hand the Beare, and the Lyon, hee will alſo deliver thee this day into my hand. But O take heed my hearts, howſoever to be led to temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be ſafe, to be led in temptation be gracious, yet except God lead us out again, it cannot any way bee glorious for us: for if hee lead us not out againe hee lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us in it, and woe bee to us when hee ſo forſaketh us, and leaveth us to our ſelves: for in ſo doing wee ſhall ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forſake him and periſh. So that this is ſure, whilſt we ſay, <hi>Lead us not into temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> wee do not begge of God, that hee would not ſuffer the
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:20885:248"/> objects of temptation to bee preſented before us, but this only, that whilſt we are in the conflict, hee would not leave us alone, but rather that hee would ſay to us, as <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaid to his ſonne <hi>God,</hi> a troop ſhall fight againſt him, but he ſhall overcome them at the laſt?</p>
               <p>But thou wilt ſay to mee, O man, How, or by what meanes can, or doth God lead a man to temptation?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, by foure meanes Firſt, by a procured deſertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by a continuall ſubduction.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by a righteous tradition.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by a neceſſary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duration.</p>
               <p>By a deſerved deſertion; for whilſt wee quench, and grieve the Spirit of God by our ſinnes, it is a righteous thing with the Lord to draw his grace from us, that by our
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:20885:248"/> falls, we may learne to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his grace by which wee ſtand.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by a continued ſubduction, which howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it bee but one, and the ſelfe ſame deſertion, yet is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in degree, and more feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full becauſe of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. Thus hee dealt with the Gentiles. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by a righteous tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, when men have abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his long ſuffering patience, he gives them over to the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of errour, and to the malice of Sathan to bee led by him at his will: ſo hee dealt with <hi>Saul.</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.4.</p>
               <p>And laſt of all by an uncu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable induration, for Sathan having gotten entry in a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, thus walking in the way of errour, hee maketh his heart daily harder and harder, till out of the hardneſſe of his heart that cannot repent, hee
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:20885:249"/> heape up wrath to himſelfe againſt the day of wrath. But thou wilt yet enquire, why doth God lead ſome men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to temptation, and out again, and others he leadeth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Temptation, but alſo lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them in it? To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Tu homo à me petis cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam, &amp; ego quoque homo ſum: ſed audiamus ambo Apoſtolum dicentem, O home, tu quis es? melior eſt fidelis ignorantia, quam temeraria ſcientia.

The preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting grace of God leadeth us not into temptation. The fellow-working, or ſecond
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:20885:250"/> grace, delivereth us from evill. Againe, as it is in the diſcipline of warre here on earth, ſo it muſt bee with the ſoule. In a battell and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict on earth, our Generall and Leader muſt firſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full that wee fall not before our enemy. And ſecondly, if we fall, and be taken captive, it is his part to bee carefull to pay our ranſome; and deliver us from the captivity and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of our enemie. It is ſo with us alſo in the ſpirituall fight, and conflicts of the ſoule: Our leader ſhould not onely be carefull, that wee get not the foile, but alſo if wee bee put to the rowte, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken captives of our enemies, it becommeth him to be carefull to redeeme and ranſome us out of the hands of all thoſe to whom wee were priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and captives I hope now by theſe two ſimilitudes you
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:20885:251"/> underſtand the conjunction and tye that is betwixt this part of the Petition and the former. For if we ſhall looke upon our ſelves, as being ſick and diſeaſed in ſoule: two things are requiſite for our health and cure. Firſt, our phyſician ſhould preſcribe us a dyet, whereby our diſeaſe may bee prevented. This is done and preſcribed in the words, <hi>Lead us not into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> The other thing which the Doctor of our ſoules oweth us, is medicine, poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, plaiſters and purgations to cure us of the ſickneſſe we are falne in: and this he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to do unto us whilſt he delivereth us from all evill. Againe, wilt thou looke on thy ſelfe as a ſouldier in the field of Jeſus, fighting againſt the ſpirituill enemies of thy ſoule, thy leader Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus promiſeth thee two
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:20885:251"/> things. Firſt, that though thou ſtumble before the enemy, yet thou ſhalt not fall: This hee promiſeth in theſe words, <hi>Leadus not &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, he promiſeth, that if at any time thou fall and get the foile, and be taken captive, and priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yet he will not let thee dye in priſon, no, hee will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme thee, and ere any of thine enemies, ſinne, death, or condemnation tryumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thee, he will lay his owne life downe for thee, and his heart blood as a ranſome for thy deliverance: and this hee promiſeth in theſe words, <hi>But deliver us from evill.</hi>

<pb n="486" facs="tcp:20885:252"/> againſt his phyſician, yet the reaſon is, hee feeleth not the ſoare, and like one tranſported in the fury of his paſſion, hee cannot tell where his paine holds him. But here is the riches of the mercy of our God, and phyſician: hee preventeth us with his cure, and not onely that, but alſo preſcribeth helpes againſt our recidivations and relapſes. This the woman of Samaria felt, when ſhee knew not the grace of God, nor who it was ſpake to her, by ſeeking a drinke of pure water, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented her, and gave her a drinke of the well of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life. Thus he prevented the man at the poole of <hi>Betheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</hi> Thus hee prevented us all in the loines of our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, <hi>Adam, where art thou.</hi> And againe when our father was an Amorite, and out mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Hetyte: when our
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:20885:252"/> haire was not cut, nor our nailes pared; when wee were wallowing in our blood, and were neither waſhed with water, nor ſoftened with oyle, hee came by, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting us with his love, ſaid to us, live, and made us live, and only becauſe of his word, commanding us to live, and therefore wee lived. Seeing then whilſt wee are ſicke and diſeaſed in ſoule, hee prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us with his unexpected cure: ſeeing alſo whilſt wee are taken priſoners, hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteth us with our undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ranſome; what are wee that wee ſhould either proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reject, or faithleſly diſtruſt the Ocean of his goodneſſe? There bee ſome I know, that hearing of this preventing grace, will proudly lay this concluſion, that they will continue ſtill in ſin that grace may abound. But knoweſt not
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:20885:253"/> thou, O vaine man, that the long ſuffering patience of God ſhould lead thee to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: and that if thou tread the blood of the covenant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy feet, that blood which ſpeaketh better things then the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, ſhall ſpeak judgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to thee, even a judgement intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable &amp; incurable. Know again, thou that art weake in faith; that that ſickneſſe and diſeaſe cannot befall thy ſoule, that ſhould make thee diſtruſt the Phyſician, whoſe love hath prevented thee with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected cure. Whilſt hee was in our fleſh, hee quickned three ſorts of dead: the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turians daughter; the widows ſonne; and <hi>Lazarus</hi> three dayes dead: and all to make thee ſtrong in faith. Why wrongeſt thou him? firſt in his juſtice, by ſinning againſt him; and next in his mercy
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:20885:253"/> by diſtruſting his goodneſſe? No, no, beleeve him under hope, and aganſt hope, and thou ſhalt finde that thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation ſhall not want his reward: for hee that ſaid to thee, <hi>Call upon mee in the day of thy trouble, and I will deliver thee,</hi> ſhall ſurely deliver thee: And thy ranſome ſhall not be wanting to thee, if thy faith bee not wanting to thy ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Now having ſpoken thus much concerning the tye of this part of the Petition with the former, it followeth now that wee looke on the words, and theſe foure things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in them. I was telling you before in my laſt Sermon, that wee are ſouldiers figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting under the banner of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who being the leader and Generall of our army, here telleth us, that the fight is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate: for if wee dye not,
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:20885:254"/> and periſh in the conflict, yet the beſt ſouldier that ever car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed armes, (except Jeſus Chriſt) hath beene taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: this figuratively he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>evill,</hi> &amp; he teacheth us to pray againſt the ſame, whilſt he ſaith, <hi>But deliver us from evill.</hi> That wee may underſtand this evill the better, wee muſt looke on the oppoſite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which is good: Know therefore that there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold good, one perſonall, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reall. The perſonall good is hee who is the fountaine and welſpring of all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, both in himſelfe, and alſo in the creature. This is God, who is not onely good, but goodneſſe it ſelfe; nothing beſide him can truly bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led good. And for this cauſe Chriſt ſaid, <hi>There is none good but one, that is God. Matt.</hi> 19. The reall good is that which is communicated from the
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:20885:254"/> fountaine to the ſtreames, from the root to the branches, from the head to the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. This is alſo twofold, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, or morall. The natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall good is that which God hath communicated to all his creatures by vertue of their creation: For God beheld the things which hee had made, and behold they were all ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good. This goodneſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſidered in the creature, is called <hi>Veſtigium deitatis,</hi> the character of the deity, for by vertue hereof it is, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever perfection wee finde in the creature, wee call it good, becauſe in this, and by this, it expreſſeth the Creator, who in himſelfe is abſolutely good, in ſo farre as a finite creature can expreſſe an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and incorruptible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. The morall good is that which God hath communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to man, in making him
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:20885:255"/> a reaſonable ſoule, a good ſo much the more excellent then that of nature, by how much man is more eminent then the beaſt, and reaſon more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then life or ſenſe. Well then, the creature is naturally good: Man is both naturally and morally good. But wee muſt know a little further; that the morall good concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited to man is twofold; it is either <hi>Bonum obedientiae,</hi> or <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num praemij:</hi> the good of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or the good of reward. The good of obedience car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a reference to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, is more then <hi>Veſtigium deitatis;</hi> for ſurely it is <hi>Ipſa imago Dei,</hi> his true and lively character: for by the obedience which wee give to the Commandements of God, wee ſhew our ſelves to be the ſonnes of God, and that by the grace of his ſpirit wee are begotten againe, to
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:20885:255"/> bee conformed to his image. The other, to wit, the good of reward, is the free dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of grace to us in this life; or of glory in the life to come. To both which wee may adde the good uſe of all the good creatures of God: for godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is great gaine, having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to it, not onely the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of this life, but alſo of that which is to come. Now that I may bee found in my text, ſeeing I have ſhewed you how many ſorts of good and goodneſſe there is, let us looke now by way of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and know the nature of evill, for this is common in the Schooles, <hi>Quot modis u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num oppoſitorum, tot modis dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur &amp; alterum.</hi> Evill then, is either perſonall or reall: the perſonall evill muſt be oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the perſonall good. God was, and is the abſolute and perſonall good: Sathan
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:20885:256"/> muſt then be the great (though not the abſolute) evill. The abſolute evill I will not call him, for hee was good by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and as hee remaineth yet in his nature and eſſence a creature, hee remaineth ſtill good: but the prime and chiefe evill of the world hee is both in reſpect of himſelfe and man. The reall evill can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee given in true termes of oppoſition, oppoſed to the reall good: for that was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther naturall or morall: Now to ſay, that there is any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture naturally evill, wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, for they are by nature created good, onely the ill which is in the creature is morall, for the beeing or eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the creature is good, whatſoever is vitious or pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant in the creature is bad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the bad quality there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. In man then, as in a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creature there are two
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:20885:256"/> evills: one of diſobedience, another of puniſhment, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the good of obedience and reward. The evill of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience we call <hi>malum cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae;</hi> the evill of puniſhment <hi>Malum poenae.</hi> The firſt is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and abſolutely evill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is repugnant to the will of God, and contrary to his law. The laſt is not ſo, but conditionally evill, to wit, in reſpect of us, becauſe it ſeemeth ſo to our taſte: for howſoever the evil of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeemes evill to man, yet it is not ſo in reſpect of God, in whoſe preſence, and by whoſe providence this <hi>malum poenae</hi> is <hi>bonum juſticiae,</hi> the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill of puniſhment is the good of his juſtice. But thou wilt enquire, O man, ſeeing there be ſo many ſorts of evill, what evill is it that we pray againſt here? I anſwer, wee pray on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the evill of ſinne:
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:20885:257"/> For the clearing whereof know, that there is a foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold combination, and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reciprocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betwixt good and evill. Firſt, the good of good. Secondly, the ill of good. Thirdly, the good of ill. fourthly, the ill of ill.</p>
               <p>The good of good, is that benefit which man reapeth of all the creatures of God; health, wealth, peace, liberty, inſtruction of the ſoule by the miniſtrie of the word.</p>
               <p>The ill of good, is that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment and harme which the wicked of the world reape out of the benefits and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of God: for whilſt hee maketh his Sunne to ſhine u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, his raine to fall on them, his creatures to feed them, and his word to bee preached to them, though theſe things be good of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet the wicked get no good, but evill by them: for
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:20885:257"/> by theſe bodily and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall favours, they are made inexcuſable, and by his ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all mercies their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is aggravated.</p>
               <p>The good of evill, is that good, which the Lord as a wiſe Phyſician extracteth out of the evills of this life which befall them: for as the phyſician maketh of a viper, a ſoveraigne remedy, and as <hi>Sampſons</hi> dead lyon afforded him a honey combe: ſo the Lord out of the worſt and baddeſt eſtate that can befall his ſervants, he worketh their good. Their bodily hunger teacheth them a ſpirituall hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, their bodily thirſt, to thirſt after righteouſneſſe; their poverty teacheth them to be rich in grace; their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe to bee clothed with ſalvation: and all their croſſes and corrections whatſoever, ſealeth to them their adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:20885:258"/> increaſeth their patience, and aſſureth them that their ſoules ſhall be ſafe in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Laſt of all, the evill of evill, is that damage and harme which the wicked ſuſtaine by ſuffering the evill of this life: for by the evill of ſinne their hearts are hardened, the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of ſinne taking away the conſcience of ſinne: and by the evill of puniſhment their condemnation is ſealed to them; for whatſoever they ſuffer in this life, is but an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt penny of their after ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and a ſure fore-runner of that worme which dyeth not, and of that fire which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not out againe. So that whilſt wee ſay, <hi>Deliver ui from evill,</hi> our meaning is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us, O Lord, from Sathan, the author of ſinne, from ſinne it ſelfe, the firſt borne of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than: and from condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:20885:258"/> the ſtipend and wages of ſinne. And as for the outward rods, compoſe them ſo to us, that they may not harden our hearts in ſinne, nor ſeale to us our condemnation. And to this interpretation of evill antiquity giveth aſſent: for S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> writing upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.19. where Chriſt calleth the devill <hi>The evil one,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Malum hic diabolum vocat, docens nos cum eo praeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um habere nullo unquam tempore dirimendum: cum tamen non ſit natura.</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Ambroſe</hi> expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it both of the devill, and of ſin: <hi>Libera nos à malo, dum hoc petimus, petit unuſquiſque, ut à malo, hoc eſt, à diabolo &amp; peccato liberetur.</hi> Finally, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Auguſt.</hi> is of the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, whilſt hee telleth us <hi>Chriſtus non liberabit nos a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baris, ſed à diabolo, &amp; peccato, &amp; peccati ſtipendio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now having ſpoken at
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:20885:259"/> length to you concerning our captivity to Sathan, ſinne, and condemnation: It is requiſite that wee looke on the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and theſe are wee: for wee ſay, <hi>deliver us.</hi> For the better underſtanding where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, wee muſt know, that cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are of two ſorts, either <hi>Captivi nati,</hi> or elſe <hi>Captivi facti:</hi> captives are either borne ſo, or made ſo. The native or borne captives, were the children of ſuch parents as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing captives themſelves, were mancipated, and ſold for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and ſlaves to others. Theſe by the Law of God were the poſſeſſion and true inheritance of their maſter. <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.45. The captives that were made ſo, are of two ſorts: for they were either made ſo by others, or by themſelves. By others, whilſt being taken in battell, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from death, they were
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:20885:259"/> ſold as ſervants &amp; bond-men to others. Captives made by themſelves were ſuch, as without any outward vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence impoſed on them, did for reliefe of their poverty and neceſſity, ſell themſelves as ſlaves and ſervants to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: Now theſe are but bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily captives. Anſwerable to theſe, there are three ſorts of ſpirituall captives, and of the captivity of the ſoule. The firſt are captives by birth, and ſo borne from their mothers wombe: ſuch are all men by nature and naturall corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for wee are all of us borne dead in our ſins and treſpaſſes, &amp;c. And what <hi>David</hi> ſaid, of himſelfe, all of us may ſay of our ſelves <hi>In iniquity was I ſhapen, and in ſin hath my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brought mee forth.</hi> Now in the ſecond place, captivity begets captivity, as one deepe calleth on another. Our ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:20885:260"/> captivity, under which we were born; hath lead us vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently captive unto actuall ſin, and rebellions: For having brought nothing into the world with us, but an uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed heart, from thence in all our life time ſpringeth nothing but abominable cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. Laſt of all, there bee ſome men, who to both their naturall and violent captivity have added a voluntary capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, making themſelves cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to ſinne and Sathan, with a greedy appetite and up lifted hand, and theſe are the children of diſobedience, from the firſt ſort of captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it hath pleaſed God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme us in our baptiſme by the lavacre of regeneration, and waſhing of the new birth. From the ſecond cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity though wee cannot bee fully delivered ſo long as wee are in this life, wee having
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:20885:260"/> received but the firſt fruits of the ſpirit, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, Jeſus Chriſt our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer hath delivered us by his death, the power of his reſurrection, and fellowſhip, of his afflictions; for it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Wee have not received the Spirit of bondage to feare againe, but the Spirit of adoption, whereby wee cry Abba, father.</hi> And againe, <hi>Therefore we are no more ſervants but ſonnes.</hi> From the laſt ſort of captivity there is no redemption at all: for if Sathan the devill hath right enough to a man by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: man ſhall adde to that captivity a greater, by ſelling himſelfe like <hi>Achab,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit iniquity. There is no more ſacrifice reſerved for that mans ſinne, but a fearefull expectation of judgement, and of that fire which ſhall devoure the wicked. Now my brethren of this which
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:20885:261"/> hath beene ſaid concerning our captivity, I would gladly that in a word or two you ſhould make ſome uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <label>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</label> There are many cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives in the world whom we cannot get delivered, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding wee will labour to extend ſome of our ſupply to them. For firſt wee can, upon the firſt hearing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate their captivity, and beare a part, and have ſome ſympathy with them in their diſtreſſe. Secondly, we can ſometimes goe further then this: for we can goe &amp; knock at the priſon dore; and call for them, and goe in and viſite them, and comfort them with our beſt conſolations. We can goe ſomewhat further yet, and beſides our comfort, wee can helpe them with ſome of our meanes: wee can buy bread to their hunger, and drinke to their thirſt, and
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:20885:261"/> clothes to their nakedneſſe. And laſt of all, we can engage our ſelves for their delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and by our engagements ſet them free. Are not theſe good offices of charity and true ſtraines of mercy? Yes ſurely they are ſo. Art not thou then much beholding to Chriſt, whoſoever thou art, that art ſet free from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of ſin: for he hath done al theſe to thee whilſt thou wert in daakneſſe, and bondage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſinne and Sathan. Hee did firſt pitty and compaſſionate thee, when thou hadſt no pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on thy ſelfe; and even then, when thou wert a ſtranger and enemy to him, hee ſpread his skirts over thee, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered thy nakedneſſe. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee hath viſited thee, as he came downe to viſit Iſrael in her affliction: not in judgment as Sodome, but in mercy, and in a plentifull compaſſion:
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:20885:262"/> and therefore <hi>Zachary</hi> bleſſeth him, for that hee viſited, and then redeemed his people. Thirdly, hee became benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to us, not onely giving us wine to make the heart glad, and oyle to make the face to ſhine, but alſo in comforting our ſoules<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hee hath given us his fleſh for meate, his blood for drinke, his righteouſneſſe for our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ing, his word for our inſtruction, and his Spirit for our guide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fourthly, and laſt of all, hee hath taken our debt upon him, and paying it for us, hath ſet us free: and this hee did in the fulneſſe of time: for when that fulneſſe came, God ſent his owne Sonne made of woman, and made under the law, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered us that were under the law, that wee might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the adoption of ſonnes. For Gods ſake therefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whilſt we were Captives,
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:20885:262"/> hee hath done ſo much for our deliverance, forget not the captivity of thy ſoule, thy ſelfe, and firſt, when thou heareſt it told thee in the word of God, pittie it.

Thirdly when thou haſt ſeene it, cry with Iſrael to <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to make thy yoke lighter: and in the end, though thou cannot procure by thy ſelfe an abſolute deliverance, yet come to him that poured out his heart blood for thee, runne and cry for thy delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and diſſolution, ſigh and groane for it, and in due time if thou faint not, thou ſhalt bee heard in that which thou feareſt. Theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus cleared to you, the third thing that wee are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke in the words, is our deliverance or releaſe in this
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:20885:263"/> word <hi>Deliver;</hi> now that wee may know this deliverance the better, it ſhall not bee amiſſe to diſtinguiſh deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance into three ſeverall ſorts. Firſt, there is a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <hi>à toto.</hi> Secondly, <hi>à tanto.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>à tali.</hi> Our delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <hi>à toto,</hi> is a perfect deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance both from tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſinne, practice of ſinne, and puniſhment for ſinne. <hi>A tante,</hi> is not perfect but partiall, from ſo much of temptation, practiſe, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment as God thinketh meete and expedient. <hi>A tali,</hi> is that whereby wee crave exemption and protection from ſinnes of grievous quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: Such as we call preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, enormious, heinous, and crying ſinnes: And from ſuch kinde of puniſhments as are not the teſtimonies of Gods love, but rather the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his wrath and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:20885:263"/> Now ſeeing delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in effect and properly is an actuall releaſe from evill, what ſort of deliverance do wee crave here, is it that wee call <hi>â toto?</hi> No, no, wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect a totall and perfect deliverance in this life: for ſo long as this life laſteth, wee can neither be totally free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinne, nor from puniſhment: notwithſtanding, becauſe of this ſame poſſibility; wee are bound to cry for our perfect deliverance by death. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as for that deliverance which is <hi>â tanto,</hi> that is to ſay, from ſo much as will make us ſlaves to ſinne or puniſhment, for this wee cry in theſe words: and this deliverance we are commanded to deſire: and by this deſire wee are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reprobate, for whilſt we are led captive to Sathan at his will, ſinne ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not (though dwelleth)
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:20885:264"/> in our mortall bodies. And for the puniſhment, the Lord hath promiſed not to tempt us above our power, but ſo farre onely as wee may bee able to beare it. Thirdly, as for the deliverance <hi>à tali,</hi> that is to ſay, from blaſphemous, preſumptuous, and crying ſinnes, which are the effects of the wrath of God upon the children of diſobedience, from theſe and ſuch as theſe, we cry, and muſt cry coutinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, <hi>Lord deliver us from evill.</hi>

                  <p>VVHen I did firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this prayer, I told you, they did reſemble a houſe or edifice. For as in the Courts and Palaces of Princes, there are firſt Courts and Porches ſerving for entrance into the royall preſence. Secondly, there are roomes and places of reſt. Laſtly, poſternes and
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:20885:265"/> paſſages of retiring, ſerving both for pleaſure, &amp; neceſſity: ſo is it in this building &amp; ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall edifice of prayer: For in it there are three diſtinct and ſeverall ſtations: A preface ſerving for the porch. Sixe ſeverall Petitions, ſerving for roomes of court. And finally a concluſion ſerving for a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne or tarras, from whence wee may in a view behold the glory and beauty of the whole palace. Of the Preface and of the Petitions wee have ſpoken already according to the meaſure of grace given us from above. It reſteth now onely that in this Sermon we take a view of the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and from it draw up the full and finall ſeale of all the prayer. And from both, their edification. When I looke on the words, I finde in them three things remarkable. Firſt, their inference. Secondly,
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:20885:265"/> their tenor and ſcope: and thirdly, their ſeale. The infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is in the word <hi>for:</hi> the tenor is <hi>Thine is the kingdome, power, and glory for ever.</hi> The ſeale in the word <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us returne then to their inference in the word <hi>For.</hi> Here it is evident, that this concluſion or laſt part of the prayer, is knit and tyed to the former Petitions with a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall particle, <hi>for.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the better underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, let us know, that againſt the neceſſity and uſe of this prayer preſcribed unto us, an objection might bee moved by the weakneſſe and infirmity of man: For let us looke on the beſt of the children of God, when hee cenſureth and examineth his owne ſoule: and paralleleth his practiſe with the deſire of theſe petitions, and wee ſhall finde that hee ſhall come farre
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:20885:266"/> ſhort of that which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of him: For when wee looke on the three firſt Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which concerne God, the honour of his name, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of his kingdome, and the obedience of his will, who is able to give that due obedience thereunto, which is required of him? Not one, for God himſelfe hath thus complained againſt man, <hi>The Lord looked downe from heaven, and beheld the actions of men, to ſee if there were any that would ſeeke after him, and do good, and hee could finde none, no not one.</hi> Againſt this it is that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets complained in the name of God, and for his ſake: <hi>Who hath beleeved our report, and to whom is the arme of God reved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led?</hi> Finally, it is againſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience and rebellion that the Saints of God have ſo deeoply ſighed and groaned for their deliverance. <hi>David</hi>

How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in ſickneſſe have called for helpe, how many in poverty have called for ſupport, and how many in exile have called for deliverance, and yet have not obtained it?

                     <pb n="516" facs="tcp:20885:267"/> Laſt of all, how many of the Sonnes, and Saints of God, having fallen into temptation and ſnares of the devill, have cryed unto God for eaſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe, and deliverance to their wounded conſcience, and have not obtained it? Let <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> witneſſe in his 51. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> Whilſt hee cryeth, <hi>Reſtore me O Lord to the joy of thy ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and take not thy free ſpirit from mee.</hi> And let the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alſo beare witneſſe, whilſt being buffeted by the angel of ſathan, he cryed thrice unto the Lord, that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of temptation might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, &amp; yet behold hee received no anſwer but this <hi>My grace is ſufficyent for thee.</hi> Now I ſay, if in all theſe, man may pray and not be heard ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, if under the body and burthen of both temporall and ſpirituall calamities hee ſigh and groane, and yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:20885:267"/> be heard in that which he feareth, wherefore, and to what end I pray you is it, that man ſhould plead in theſe words of Petition? or why ſhould they bee tyed to this forme and platforme of prayer?</p>
                  <p>To this it is, that our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt giveth an anſwer in this word <hi>For, &amp;c.</hi> for in ſo ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hee ſtrengtheneth and ſtayeth the weake hearts, and feeble knees of his ſervants againſt all feare and infidelity whatſoever, by leading them to the conſideration of the might, power, and glory of him to whom wee pray. So that his meaning is, whilſt he ſaith <hi>For, &amp;c.</hi> poore and weake creature that thou art, wouldſt thou draw neere to God? faint not, though at the firſt thou obtaine not the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; poſſeſſe thy ſoule in
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:20885:268"/> patience, hold faſt that which thou haſt received, continue conſtant in prayer, for hee is a great and mighty God whom thou ſupplicateſt, and hee is both willing and able to keep that which thou haſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credited unto him, though hee winke at ſpirituall or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall deſertions for a while, yet bee ſure hee will come at laſt, and ſalvation under his wings, and a mighty delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance under, his right hand. For never King on earth had either ſuch power to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, or affection to pitty or commiſerate his ſubjects as God hath to the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his Saints. For hee is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and his and his onely are all kingdomes, all power, and glory for ever.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</label> I ſee man is a weake creature, weake in all things, for he is weak in knowledge, in obedience, and in ſuffering, But eſpecially weake in faith. I ſay, hee is weake in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, for hee knoweth not the things of God, neither can hee know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned: weake in obedience, for the good that hee would do, that he doth not, and the evill that he would not do, that he is led captive to doe. In ſuffering, for the bread and water of affliction are hard for him to digeſt: and who is hee who will gladly deny himſelfe, and take up his croſſe and follow Jeſus. But wee are chiefly and above all, weake in faith, for even then, when God hath made us in his light to ſee light, and when hee hath in ſome meaſure captivated our
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:20885:269"/> affections unto his obedience, when hee hath ſanctified our croſſe, and given us ſome meaſure of patience under it; and finally, when hee hath led us by the hand, unto the throne of grace, and there by the power of his ſpirit, hath taught us to poure out our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires before him with ſighs which cannot bee expreſſed, unleſſe in an inſtant, and at the firſt cry wee bee heard in that which wee feare, and get out petitions anſwered, with a ſutable correſpondence: O how weary are wee, how faint, and how doubt wee of the love and mercy of our God towards us! yet here is the love of God made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that though our ſinne bee out of meaſure ſinfull, yet his grace is a rich grace, and hee multiplyeth unto us grace u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon grace, inſomuch that hee will not onely call upon us to
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:20885:269"/> come unto him in the day of our trouble, that hee may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us: but when wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come, hee will draw us, and when wee are come, hee wil teach us both how, and what to pray: and finally, when wee begin to doubt, and fall to deſpaire, hee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propeth our weake faith by the arguments of his love, his power, and his glory. It is our part therfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we addres our ſelves to God by prayer, to make theſe his peculiar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, not onely the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of our deſires and trenchmen, our hearts beſt wiſhes, but alſo by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, and faithfull evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to make them arguments to our ſelves of our audience: for as the prayer of faith avai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth much if it be ferve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: ſo the faint-hearted &amp; lewk-warme deſires of men reap nothing at Gods hands, unleſſe perhaps it
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:20885:270"/> make him caſt back the duſt of their facrifices into their faces, and turne their prayer into ſin. And thus much. I have ſpoken for the word of inference here uſed, <hi>For.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wee muſt come now and looke on the tenor of the words, wherein our Saviour and Redeemer comforteth and ſtayeth our weake faith, and ſtrengthen eith us in our prayers, both from doubting and deſpaire. The arguments hee draweth out for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement are two: The firſt is drawne from that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and ſupreme ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty which hee hath not onely over man, but alſo over heaven, earth, and hell, and all the hoſts and inhabitants thereof. The ſecond is drawn from the true titles, dignity, or attributes of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and theſe are three. A powerfull, a glorious, and
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:20885:270"/> an eternall &amp; everlaſting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. But let us return to the firſt argument, of faith and incouragement to confidence in our prayer, which is taken from Gods kingdome: For by this meanes hee maketh a direct reciproeation betwixt this concluſion, and the ſecond Petition of this prayer: and withall a direct oppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt this concluſion, and the laſt Petition. In the ſecond Petition he taught us to ſeeke the advancement of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in theſe words, <hi>Let thy kingdome come.</hi> In theſe words hee letteth us ſee that hee will ſeeke nothing of us by way of obedience, but that which hee will enable us to do. Therefore he aſcribeth to himſelfe a ſupreme ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over all the world, and a kingdome more eminent then all thoſe which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the ſonnes of men:
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:20885:271"/> to teach us, that as kings do not impoſe lawes upon their ſubjects to bee ſnares unto them, of rebellion and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but rather ſtatutes ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie for obſervance, juſt in their exaction, and ſafe in their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: ſo God who is our Supreme and dread Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, as hee requireth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of his ſtatutes, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie our homage and loyalty to him, ſo alſo as a mighty and juſt king, hee will both enable us to do that which hee requireth of us, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect us in the doing thereof, againſt all our enemies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. Againe, as it carryeth a direct reference and recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with the ſecond Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: ſo doth it alſo import a direct oppoſition to the laſt Petition, for therein wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that wee had many enemies, the devill, the world, and our owne fleſh,
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:20885:271"/> as Kings and Tyrants not only dwelling in us, but alſo tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing over us, and leading us captive unto ſinne: and what comfort could wee have in this our conflict, or what hope of victory ſhould there bee left to <hi>David,</hi> againſt the ſonnes of <hi>Zerviah,</hi> unleſſe our leader were a King, more mighty then theſe: A monarch more powerfull to ſave, then they to deſtroy? Surely none at all: But know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there are more with us then againſt us, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the lyon of the tribe of <hi>Iudah</hi> is ſtronger then the ſtrong man which keepeth us in captivity, what need wee to be afraid? if an earthly king will not ſuffer a wrong done unto his ſubject to bee unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, do wee thinke that King of Kings, our Lord, and our God, will ſuffer Sathan to keepe us alwayes in captivity?
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:20885:272"/> No ſurely: he may wel ſuffer us like <hi>David</hi> for a while to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at Jericho, untill our beards and garments be renewed, but at laſt hee will ſmite our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hippe and thigh, and wound them with a wound in their loynes, that they ſhall not bee able to riſe againe. This then is the cauſe why he ſtileth himſelfe, not onely a King, but the King, by way of excellency and eminencie above all Kings whatſoever. You may remember whilſt we ſpake of the kingdome of God in the ſecond petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this prayer, wee told you, that Sathan had a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: man had a kingdome: and God had a kingdome. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans kingdome was no true kingdome, for it was and is no other thing then a meere uſurpation, and an inforced tyranny over the hearts of men, which onely of due ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:20885:272"/> unto the Lord. Mans kingdome is onely a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by toleration and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation from God: but Gods kingdome onely is the true kingdome both in name and nature, for all things are of him, and through him, and for him, that in all things hee may have the preheminence. Juſtly therefore may our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our teach us, and we learne to ſay unto God, <hi>Thine is the kingdome:</hi> For Sathans king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <hi>Carcer eſt, non regnum,</hi> ſaith S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                     <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Mans kingdome is but ſubordinate, for it is written, <hi>Per me reges regnant,</hi> by mee kings raigne: onely God is the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, higher then the higheſt a mongſt the ſonnes of men: and to him onely of due appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the kingdome, the power, and the glory for ever.</p>

<pb n="528" facs="tcp:20885:273"/> hereof ſhould comfort us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly in the middeſt of our greateſt calamities, and diſtreſſe: For wee are not the ſubjects of that king, who is careleſſe of our captivity and tribulation: No, but wee have him for our head and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne who knoweth our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities from a farre, and is touched with a ſenſe of our ſufferings: and finally, which is more materiall for our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, hee is the King of Kings, the ſupreme and dread ſoveraigne of all creatures, not onely willing but alſo powerfull and able ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly to helpe us: As it is written to the <hi>Epheſ.

                     <hi>Iude</hi> teſtifieth the ſame, <hi>To him that is able to keepe you that you fall not, &amp;c.</hi> What need wee then bee afraid of

If wee dwell in the tabernacle of the moſt high, and abide under the ſhadow of his wings, no evill ſhall come neare us: for he hath a hooke for the noſtrels, and a bridle for the lips of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that riſe againſt us. They may come out one way againſt us, but they ſhall fly ſeaven waies before us: for hee is a mighty King that leadeth us: and who hath wraſtled with him at any time, and beene victorious? Let us not feare then what man can do unto us. Men are Kings, but none can ſay that hee is the King, except God alone.

The titles are three, <hi>Power, Glory,</hi> and <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> Firſt then hee ſaith, that Gods kingdome is a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of power.</p>
                  <p>Wee muſt know that the power of God is taken many ſeverall wayes in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for the eſſentiall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of God, which being in himſelfe is himſelfe, and of him, and from him, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the creature, giveth unto it an eſſence, beeing, power, and force of action, to do whatſoever hee doth: and this eſſentiall propertie is common to the Father, with the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is taken for Jeſus Chriſt, the ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:20885:275"/> of the Trinity. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. <hi>To them that are called, as well of the Iewes as of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, wee preach Ieſus Chriſt, the power and wiſdome of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it ſignifieth the Ghoſpell of Jeſus, and the word of the Evangell. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell of Chriſt, for it is the power of God to ſalvation to every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving ſoule.</hi> But here by the word power, is underſtood, that all-ſufficient omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, which being in God is God, and by him maketh all things to bee which are. And as all power is in him <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam in capite,</hi> ſo is all power from him <hi>tanquam à fonte.</hi> This our Saviour acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged when hee told <hi>Pilate, Thou couldeſt have no power over mee, unleſſe it were given thee from above.</hi> Unto this the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſubſcribeth <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. <hi>There is no power but of
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:20885:275"/> God, and the powers that are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God.</hi> Now this title of Gods power, Chriſt bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in here as an attribute, by which hee may underproppe our weakeneſſe. And his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, O man, why doubteſt thou, and why art thou fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to come to God, and pray to him? How many eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces haſt thou of his power manifeſted to thee for thy protection? Is it not by him, and by his power, that thou liveſt, moveſt, and haſt thy beeing? was it not by him, &amp; by the word of his power, that all things were made of nothing? Is it not by him, and by the might of his power, that all things are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in that ſtate, order and frame in which they now are? Was it not by him, and the might of his power, that fire came downe to deſtroy So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. That the ſeadrowned
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:20885:276"/> 
                     <hi>Pharo,</hi> the earth ſwallowed up <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom?</hi> That <hi>Ieroboams</hi> hand was dryed up, that the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſſe fire had mercy on the children, and the hungry ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons fed not on <hi>Daniel?</hi> That the windes and ſeas are ſtilled and calmed, and finally that the very devills of hell are curbed, that they cannot goe beyond the chaine of his power and good pleaſure? Theſe things are all evidences of his power. But his power is yet not knowne in things that are ſpirituall. Looke to our eternall election, our temporall redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, our effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall calling, the reſurrection of our bodies, and upon the glory beſtowed both upon ſoule and body, and from thence let us never doubt of his power. Hee of himſelfe is able to do all things, and by his power wee are able to do
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:20885:276"/> all things: and hee hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted his power towards us, that by it wee may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, by it comforted, and by it corrected. In a word, it ſerveth for our inſtruction, correction, and conſolation. For our inſtruction in the path of charity; for our correction in the way of our preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for our conſolation in the day of our trouble.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for our inſtruction in the path of charity: For wee do no ſooner ſee our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour fall, but ſtraight way we are preciſe and prejudicate cenſurers, not remembring our ſelves leſt wee alſo bee tempted; Nor yet remembring the power of God who is able to ingraffe thoſe againe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.4.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it ſerveth for our correction in the way of our preſumption: for wee thinke, if man can befriend us wee are
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:20885:277"/> ſafe and ſure; but as fooles wee vaniſh, for the Egyptians are but men, not gods, and their horſes are but fleſh, not ſpirit. When <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſaw his wound, and <hi>Iudah</hi> felt his ſoare, they ranne to <hi>Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Aſhur,</hi> but their wound was not healed; for there is no helpe but in the Lord: And whoſoever ſhall ſeeke helpe beſide him, may aske coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell at his ſtocke, but his ſtaffe ſhall anſwer him; for the Lord ſhall meete him as a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and as a lyons whelpe ſhall teare him in peeces, and none ſhall deliver him.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, it ſerveth for our comfort in the day of trouble. Man, beare thou the croſſe that God hath laid upon thee, for thy haires bee numbred, thy teares be put in his bottle, be thou aſſured that the Lord will deliver thee in the day of trouble, when thou art incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:20885:277"/> with the waters of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction. The ſecond attribute of his kingdome is glory, which hath many ſeverall ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Firſt it is taken for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God, which whilſt man doth celebrate, it is ſaid, they ſhew forth his glory. Thus did the ſheepheards heare that ſweete <hi>Haliluiah</hi> ſang by the Angells, <hi>Glory bee to God on high.</hi> And <hi>David, Pſalm.</hi> 8. <hi>The heavens declare the glory of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, by the glory of God in the time of the Law, was meant the Arke of God, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. <hi>The glory is departed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it ſignifieth the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible teſtimony of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in a cloud. <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.8.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is taken for the light of the Goſpell. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, by the glory of God, is underſtood the image
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:20885:278"/> of God, according to which man was created. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. All fleſh have ſinned, and are deprived of the glory of God.</p>

                     <hi>THis is life everlaſting, to know thee to bee the onely true God, and whom thou haſt ſent thy Sonne, the Lord Ieſus:</hi> This is the abſolute excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of mans knowledge. But to attaine hereunto the way is hard, for <hi>No man hath knowne the Father at any time ſave the Son, and he to whom the Sonne hath revealed him.</hi> And till the Sonne hath revealed him in his beeing, by delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to them the back-parts of the Father, for, <hi>No man can ſee God and live.</hi> It is true indeed if wee ſhall compare our knowledge of God, who live under the Goſpell, with thoſe who went before us under the Law, wee cannot but confeſſe that our light in regard of theirs is before the light of the
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:20885:279"/> Sunne compared to the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtarre, for it is written, <hi>They ſaw but from a farre, and under a vaile, but wee behold his glory with open face.</hi> And yet notwithſtanding this our illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination we are imperfect, &amp; our perfection may bee full in reſpect of parts, yet is not in reſpect of degrees: For our helpe therefore whilſt wee dwell in the valley of <hi>Meſeck,</hi> &amp; tents of <hi>Kedar,</hi> he is pleaſed to manifeſt unto us, though not abſolutely what he is, that is to ſay, his nature, yet who hee is, that is to ſay, what are his attributes; for by this hee teacheth us to know both who hee is in himſelfe, and how he carries himſelfe to us. Now thus we may know him in his wayes and diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards us. Hee hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed himſelfe three manner of wayes, <hi>Per viam negationis, per viam cauſationis, per viam
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:20885:279"/> eminentiae.</hi> By way of negati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by way of cauſation, and by way of excellency.</p>
                  <p>By way of negation or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyall, hee makes himſelfe knowne to us while hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the imperfections of the creatures to appertaine unto him as creator: and therefore it is ſaid of him that he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, inviſible, immutable, that hee cannot lie, that hee cannot repent.</p>
                  <p>By way of cauſation, while hee makes himſelfe to bee knowne to be the cauſe of all things that are, for it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>By him were made all things, and without him was made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was made.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>In him wee live, wee move and have our beeing.</hi> And againe, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                  <p>By way of excellency, while as we looking on the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the creature, are lead to conſider the ſupereminent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:20885:280"/> of the creator, in his wiſdome, power, ſtrength, or permanency. Hence it is that by way of eminent excellency above the creature, hee hath made, amongſt many his other attributes, himſelfe known to us by his eternity, an attribute ſo abſolutely proper to him, that it cannot properly be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to any creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide him: It is true indeed, the decrees of God are truly called eternall in their act, but not if wee conſider them in their execution; for howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they were decreed from all eternity, yet they are finite in reſpect of time, for in time they receive their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment. The ſoules of men are truly called eternall, yet not properly, for howſoever they be eternall eſſences indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for ever, yet had they a beginning in time, for till God breathed in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s noſtrels,
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:20885:280"/> man was not a living ſoule: The Sacrament of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was called the eternall covenant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. yet it is but catachreſtically termed ſo, for properly it was not ſo, it had a beginning in the dayes of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Nothing then can be properly called eternall but God himſelfe, in reſpect of his eternall eſſence and the blood of the Sonne of God, in reſpect of the eternall value thereof. God, in reſpect of his eternall eſſence, &amp; trinity of perſons, is from everlaſting to everlaſting, for this is his name <hi>I am that I am.</hi> The value alſo of the blood of the Son of God is eternall, though not in reſpect of the incarnation, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the operation thereof, for by the blood of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate lambe, ſlaine before the foundations of the world, in time wee have received peace &amp; attonement <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </gap>, conformity vnto his image, and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the grace wherein we ſtand. But thou wilt enquire if God onely bee truly and properly eternall, how is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity according to his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and that his kingdome is for ever and ever. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is eaſie, whatſoever is in God is God, and his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes are like unto himſelfe, for as hee is in himſelfe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, ſo is his kingdome, his power, and glory. The conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of theſe things ſerves us for a manifold uſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, our God is eternall, and ſo is his love to wards us, <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of God? ſhall tribulation or anguiſh, famine, or nakedneſſe? &amp;c. No, in all theſe things wee are more then conquerers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the vertue of the death of Jeſus is eternall, <hi>Who
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:20885:281"/> ſhall lay any thing then, to the charge of Gods choſen? It is God that juſtifies who ſhall condemne? It is Ieſus Chriſt who hath died for us, and now in the heavens makes interceſſion for us, at the right hand of the Majeſty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God is eternall, and his kingdome is for ever, what need wee then to feare what man can doe unto us, they can but kill the body, but, <hi>Let us feare him who can caſt both ſoule and body in hell fire, where the worme dyes not, and the fire goes not out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, our God is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and his kingdome for ever and ever: Why ſhould wee then ſeeke the things of this life that periſh? No no, it becomes us not to ſet our eyes on things that are ſeene, and are temporall, but on thoſe things that are not ſeen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and are eternall.</p>
                  <p>Finally, ſince our God is
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:20885:282"/> eternall &amp; his kingdome endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for ever, why ſhould we weary or murmur under the rod of our viſitation, for all the afflictions of this preſent time are not worthy of the glory to be revealed, for our afflictions are but light, and endure for a moment, but it is an eternall weight of glory, paſſing in excellency, that is laid up for us, who are kept by the power of his Sonne through faith to eternall ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally, it ſignifies to us Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Trinity, for it is thus written. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.14. Theſe things ſaith <hi>Amen,</hi> the faithfull and the true witneſſe. Neither this alone, but what is more, it gives a reality to
